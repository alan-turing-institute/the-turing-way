Jenkins is a good tool for running tests locally.

Ask folks what they CURRENTLY do to check that their work is right.

- Make a plot and visually inspect it

- Describe a dataframe and check that the means and standard deviations are within the right range

- Run a few different random simulations and check that they all give back values that are in the right range

Give them some examples of code tests that do exactly these steps!

(Note that its difficult to do this for images)


There are some really standard unit tests that I (Kirstie) personally find a bit unhelpful to get started with. For example checking that the values returned are floats rather than integers or strings etc is not a thing that I’m usually super worried about!

But checking the length of lists is a good one, or making sure that before I merge two data frames they DO actually have the heading in common?

I think the most important thing in this section is to make sure its clear why testing is the SELFISH option, not the goodie two shoes option!! It helps YOU check that your work actually works.

To be honest, the unit tests are cute but I don’t think they’re the best places to start - in the real world the way that I test my code is to actually see if it runs without errors all the way to the end! I think getting people up and running with this end-to-end kinda “test” might be the easiest way to get over the activation energy of learning something new

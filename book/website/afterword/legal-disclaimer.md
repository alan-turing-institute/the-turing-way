## Summary
The Turing Way is a lightly opinionated guide to reproducible research. It is *not* a source of legal advice and should never be treated as such. 

## Good legal advice is timely, specific, and given by a legal expert 
The Turing Way is not these things. 

The Turing Way is not written to be a source of legal expertise. 
When laws and regulations are referenced, the information provided is heavily simplified. 
The intent is to give you an overview of the basics, so that you will know when to check whether something you want to do has potential legal ramifications. 

Donâ€™t make any important decisions based solely on information about laws and regulations in this book..

### Finding legal expertise
If you are part of an organisation such as a university, a non-profit or a company, it is very likely that you can access legal advice either in-house or from a specialist firm that already works with your institution or organisation. 
You should check with them first if you have any concerns.

If you are not part of an institution or organisation: 
- There are law firms that specialise in data and technology who can provide advice in many jurisdictions (see below).
- Many governments make their laws and regulations available online: be aware, however, that these can often be difficult to understand without specialist training.
- In some jurisdictions, there are charities and non-profits who produce guidance for complying with laws. They should be clear about the limits of the advice they are able to provide. 

### Jurisdictions
Laws are different in different places. 
You should make sure that you are aware of which juridisctions you are operating in and that you are complying with all the laws that cover all the relevant jurisdictions. 
If you are not sure, start by contacting a legal advisor in the place that you are currently working: they will also be able to advise on what other jurisdictions you should be thinking about.

## Checklist
[ ] Do I know who I should ask if I need legal advice or expertise?
[ ] Do I know what legal advice I should seek?

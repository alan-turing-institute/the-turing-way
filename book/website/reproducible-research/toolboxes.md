 ensuring that research code is reproducible. 

## Chapter content
## Data science toolboxes
Toolboxes like scipy, scikit-learn or Keras among many others, are the workhorses of contemporary data science. Toolboxes collect and provide various methods that help solve common data science problems through a modular and principled interface. For example, scipy provides tools for scientific computing, scikit-learn for tradtional machine learning, and Keras for deep learning. 

Toolboxes facilitate reproducible research through a number of ways.

* Toolboxes organise methods into categories and hierarchies, and provide a consistent user interface for similar methods. A user interface defines the points of interaction between the methods and users. Developing a consistent interface has many advantages: 
    * It make it very easy for people to re-use methods, as they only have to learn how to use the common interface, instead of learning how to use each method separately, and thus reduces the cognitive load of researchers. 
    * It also makes sure that methods are easily re-usable because they can be interchanged without having to re-write much code. 
    * It also enables us to develop new composite methods that compose simple methods (e.g. ensembling). 
    * It also helps to make methods more understandable, as it clearly defines how methods can be used, what inputs and parameters they require, and what outputs they generate. 
    * Organising methods into categories and hierarchies shows how methods are related, what their differences and similarities are, and what alternatives exist. 
* By providing common methods, toolboxes allow to rapidly prototype and explore new methods and to quickly compare them against available alternatives. They also make sure that new results can easily be validated and compared against existing methods (e.g. when comparing algorithmic performance). 
* Toolboxes often encourage appropriate data science workflows. This is because consistent interfaces make clear how and in which sequence methods are supposed to be used. Toolboxes also break up more complex workflows into modular steps and provide tools for solving each step. This facilitate user interaction and allows users to easily inspect and interchange steps in workflows.
* Toolboxes ensure that key parts of research code is unit and field tested by the wider data science community. This is because toolboxes are used across different application domains. It is also because consistent interfaces make it easier to develop a set of common unit tests that all methods with the same interface have to pass.

Many data science toolboxes are open-source too, and as such they also benefit research by providing re-usable, checkable and collaborative tools, as discussed in section [].

## What is a risk assessment?
Even though "risk assessment" sounds like something more suitable for a committee to work on, we all use risk assessments all the time. 
Sometimes they’re formal procedures to ensure an activity is safe, but most of the time they’re the thought of a moment: "Is this coffee too hot?" or "Is there a bus coming?". 
At their core, risk assessments are about evaluating the possible outcomes of an event. Some outcomes are desirable, but others are unwanted or harmful.

Software is no different. 
In software engineering, making some form of risk assessment goes a long way in ensuring the robustness and longevity of your code. 
Acknowledging and managing risk can take place at multiple levels in your project. 
At a high level, for example, you could be considering the pros and cons of a certain architectural decision. 
Or, in your day-to-day work, you could be evaluating the necessity of adding a new feature that might impact the rest of the code.
Thinking about the ways in which code can break is useful for writing high-quality software. 

## Where to start?
An informal/unstructured risk assessment is much better than no risk assessment at all, so it isn't always the case that you need to invest time in finding and using a framework.
That said, these can be useful in organising your thinking and fostering a mindset to embrace risk but mitigate it as much as possible.
The next sub-chapter presents one of the most commonly used frameworks: the risk matrix.

# Translating _The Turing Way_

### Using Transifex as tranlation platform

The translation process is done on the [Transifex platform](https://www.transifex.com/theturingway/theturingway/dashboard/). To access the platform open an account and contact the The Turing Way management team to get access to the project.

In Transifex you can have 3 different roles:

- Translator  
- Reviewer
- Coordinators (in this role you can both review and translate)

## Starting a new language translation 

### Request a new language on Transifex 

In the _The Turing Way_ [translation dashboard](https://www.transifex.com/theturingway/theturingway/dashboard/) you can check out the existing languages being translated. If you do not see the language you are interested on you can request for a new language in a tab in the bottom right of the page.   

### Define norms of translation
It is key to set translation norms. These norms will guide new comers how to translate and review in the translation platform. 

### Create a dedicated slack channel

We recommend you to create a dedicated slack channel for the language you are translating within the [_The Turing Way_ slack](theturingway.slack.com). This space will allow you to bring chat with interested parties in your own language. 

### Organise co-working calls
We suggest to define co-working calls to progress on the translation. These sessions should be open to anyone interested in participating.

You can also work on the translation in the co-working calls of The Turing Way project. You can find this activity in [_The Turing Way_ calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=dGhldHVyaW5nd2F5QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ). Please note that these calls are in English.

### Asynchronous translation:

Everyone interested in participating in a translation effort should be able to work asynchronously, have this in mind when writing the translation norms and any other documentation for your language.


## Translating an existing language


### Before you start translating: 
The Transifex translation platform looks like the screenshot below. On the left are the text blocks to be translated and on the right is the translation box. You can select with the cursor which block to translate. 

We recommend that you look at a translated chapter before you start translating to familiarise yourself with the process and the translation style.

### Tranlation tools
We recommend using [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/) as a translation tool. The translation platform of DeepL looks like in the screenshot below. On the left are the blocks of text to be translated and on the right is the translation box. 
 
Tip: When you click on one of the translated words, the tool recommends a series of synonyms. These can be useful especially with long texts.

### Read the translation rules

These rules are essential to harmonise and standardise translations. Make sure you read them before you start translating for the first time.

### Priority list of chapters to translate
In each co-working or external session, prioritise those chapters that are close to completion.

# How to enter *The Turing Way*

*The Turing Way* is an open source project that involves a diverse community of researchers in making data science reproducible, ethical and inclusive for everyone.
*The Turing Way* book is hosted on GitHub under CC-BY 4.0 license. 
It is open for anyone to use, contribute to and share. 

The Online Book is the visible product of the work we do in the project, but, the process of collaborative development with the help of its community is what we value the most.
The backbone of this process lies in supporting its community by providing an open, accessible and inclusive space where they are appreciated, upskilled and given opportunities to contribute to the project in a way that is most meaningful for them.
In turn, these members support each other in the community, collaborate on mutually beneficial ideas and resources, co-develop chapters, review and improve existing materials, share them with the wider community, make new connections and develop a sense of belonging and shared-ownership in the project.

Since 2019, the project has grown into an international community of people with diverse backgrounds, research domains, expertise, knowledge and lived-experiences. 
Simultaneously, multiple pathways have evolved that interested members can take to engage in the project.
Though most of these pathways have been mentioned in various chapters, we have also noticed that often it is hard for people to enter an ongoing project when they don't know what their role in the community would look like.

## Overview of Resources You Can Use

First, we provide an overview of different platforms, community-led efforts, possible roles and opportunities for collaboration in the community.

In the next subchapters, you will find descriptions of different resources mentioned in the overview table.
Then we describe other ongoing efforts in the project that you can use to join and ideas for the kind of initiatives you can lead while collaborating with others in continuing your journey within *The Turing Way*.
Finally, we share some personal motivations of our current members for participating in this project and aspects of their work they find meaningful and beneficial.

| Can I see what people are discussing about without having to participate right now? | You are welcome to read comments on GitHub and visit Slack channels without joining the conversation. |
| Oh! But I have some thoughts and feedback on an ongoing discussion. | Great! Why wait? Join the conversation. We would be delighted to welcome your thoughts. | 
| I read a chapter and want to clarify a minor technical/conceptual thing. Can I simply ask it without opening an issue? | Yes. Please ask away on a suitable Slack channel. |
| I saw a typo or factual error in a chapter, how can I fix it? | (i) You can raise the error by opening a GitHub issue. (ii) You can also directly fix the error by using the 'suggest edit' option on Netlify, that will help in opening a Pull Request. (iii) If you get stuck, ask help in troubleshooting on Slack. |
| I am not very comfortable with GitHub, I don't want to do something wrong on the repository. Help! | We can assure you that you would not 'break' the GitHub repository. Everything there is reversible, thanks to `git` version control system. We encourage you to try out GitHub by fixing some minor errors marked as [good first issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). |
| I want to report a bug. | Use the [bug report issue template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/new/choose). |

| Do I have to write the whole chapter when I propose an idea? | You can always invite contributions from others. Do as little as you can, or as much you would like. |
| I saw someone working on a topic that I know a few things about. Can I collaborate in their Pull Request or issue? | Please do comment under the appropriate issue of Pull Request to indicate your interest to collaborate. You can offer your support to review the chapter or co-write the chapter. You can also contribute by creating illustrations of helping add references. |

# Designing Presentations

There are multiple ways to present research for outreach, for example, PowerPoint presentations, posters and interactive demos.
Each of these has different impacts on different audience groups, therefore one method of presentation may not always be suitable.
It is up to us as the presenters to consider the approach that could be most effective for our audience.

Here are a few practical tips for the presentation of research outcomes, which will help us decide how to best approach our outreach activities:

## Share the main take away

Start your outreach plan by defining the main take away.
This should be 1 or 2 sentences that you want our audience to know and understand from our presentation.
This can be used for advertising the event and reiterated in the presentation.
This is relevant for scientific presentations in all three phases:
  * Starting by introducing what we are going to tell them.
  * Telling them the story that we brought for them and describe the main lessons.
  * Ending by revisiting the main lessons we told them.

Starting and finishing with the same conclusion re-enforces the main take-away message and allows early leavers, late arrivals, and distracted people to still follow our presentation.

## Tell a story

Nobody wants to be bored and storytelling is a powerful tool to engage everyone.
To make the most impact, a presentation needs to be memorable and be able to convey the information over and over without distorting the accuracy.
Building a research project into a coherent story can help this happen.
Some might disagree that serious research work and results should be treated with the gravitas that a story cannot deliver.
However, all that we do is a story that involves teams and researchers, their specific motivation and hopes, a series of intricate methods and experiments they conduct, observations and interpretations they make - all in the search of new knowledge. This is the story you should be telling more widely so that more people can relate to what you do, give importance to the knowledge you are imparting, learn from your knowledge and understand the process that you take to deliver the research.

## Know your audience

Before designing our presentation, we should identify who our audience group is, what knowledge they may or may not have and what kind of presentation would be interesting for them.
In any case, we should avoid jargon and acronyms to avoid alienating our audience and creating a welcoming atmosphere that invites questions.
When interacting with people from different research backgrounds, we should not assume that everyone will have an equal level of understanding and hence introducing common terminology is always useful.
Contrary to this, a room full of domain experts would find a discussion on fundamental concepts probably too 'basic' and may appreciate if you check their prior knowledge beforehand, for example, using a pre-event survey.

We should also consider the age group of our audience and what information is appropriate or relevant in their life.
Children aren't going to be enthralled by how a machine learning implementation could save money on household bills but will be captivated by literally anything involving dinosaurs.

## Experiment with different communication styles

There are a number of different models describing how we can communicate new information to ensure engagement from our audience.
For example, the [VARK model](https://vark-learn.com) was developed by Neil Fleming that identifies 4 learning style "preference": Visual, Aural, Read/Write and Kinesthetic.
It is important to note (in Fleming's word), "VARK tells you about the preference of communication. It tells you nothing about the quality of that communication."
We can learn about these styles to design engaging presentations for our audience.

* Visual: Making our audience see the information so that they can visualise the relationships between ideas.
For this, we can use infographics, charts, video or pictures on our slides to help them connect a visual element with what we are saying.

* Auditory: Communicating information that our audience can hear rather than just read it.
To help our audience to capture the key messages, we can get them to recite it out loud, this can be done in form of a Q&A session.
For example, after teaching a group a new concept ask them "Can you tell me in your own words what we just learned?".

* Reading/Writing: Interacting with text is a powerful way to digest information, whether this is reading from a document or writing notes during a seminar/lecture or anonymously responding to a poll.
Giving our audience annotated handouts at the start of a talk can help them follow our presentation well.

* Kinesthetic: A hands-on approach to get our audience interact with a demo can enhance their learning experience of our presentation.
This can be done by interactive visualisation, which is quite useful for online presentations.

## Encourage audience interaction

We always hope to present our research in a way that leaves our audience excited and curious about new ideas.
It is common for presentations to be followed by a Q&A session.
Traditionally, this would mean raising hands or coming to the front of the auditorium situation. However, this classical approach does not always encourage inclusivity and diversity.
A solution to this is to use online apps such as [sli.do](https://www.sli.do) or [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/), where the audience can ask questions, vote in polls, and be part of the discussion without having to race to a microphone or be left to the random chance of being picked with their hand up.
This type of tool creates a more inclusive environment, people are less afraid of asking questions, and it generates a more diverse and relevant pool of questions.
It also encourages discussion to be continued past our presenting time slot as we can answer questions through a web interface.

## Consider multiple channels

Listed here is a non-exhaustive selection of channels for communication and outreach with some thoughts on each.
The delivery method will change drastically depending on our audience, the message we wish to deliver, and the available media formats.

* White paper: Very formal. Lots of place for detail.
Primarily, from researcher to researcher.
More of interest in technical results and methodology.
* Traditional media articles (magazines and newspapers): Much more public consumption.
The large, wide audience where less context can be assumed.
Interest is going to be in impact rather instead of results.
* Social media: Needs to be very short but can have the widest reach. Contains the least amount of content and context.
Generally only good for headlines.
Include links to more detail.
This can be a good way to have communication with people directly.
Chance to develop a discussion but also can encounter trolls.
* Personal blogs: Generally not a wide reach but can have good reception to our local community.
Good place for items that don't naturally fit in anywhere else, like personal projects.
* Institutional blogs: Potential for a wide reach and lead to talks or funding opportunities.
The audience will more likely have domain-specific knowledge.

## Use a wide range of formats

Even the most interesting person can't make a long non-interactive PowerPoint presentation exciting.
Avoid becoming monotonous by varying how you are presenting.
Consider using:

* Images: Appropriate and simple images are a good way to engage the audience as well as giving information. Remember a picture can portray a lot more than words can.
* Graphs: Using graphs to portray information can be very powerful, but we must be careful. Changing a graph or combining graphs which are unrelated for ease of reading can easily be misunderstood.
* Animations: Animations are a great way to explain complicated concepts that can't be replicated at a human scale, for example, molecular science or cosmology.
* Video: Has an expert in the field recently discussed the concept we are talking about or discussed an application we are presenting? We can use short video clips to give supporting evidence. Be cautious of the distribution and licensing of any videos that can be used.
* Audio: Audio can give weight to an otherwise silent video or animation. Use it to guide the audience's emotion.
For example: imagine seeing a video of a supernova explosion.
In reality, an observer would not hear any noise as sound does not travel in space, but videos can be effective at portraying the size and power of a supernova explosion with a well-designed audio-track.

## Reflective practice makes perfect

Standing up and being able to do a talk or present a demonstration without any practice is a rare skill and one that is developed over time.
For the majority of people practice combined with feedback, reflection and improvement are an essential ingredient to delivering a professional presentation with more confidence.
Listed here are a few techniques to help with reflective practice.

* Recording: By hearing and seeing yourself you can be in your own audience, you can notice when you speak too fast or use the wrong inflexion.
Don't worry initially about timing or messing up, use your recordings to make notes on your presentation and try and implement them a second time.
As with most practice methods, this is an iterative process.

* Present to your peers: Since it is very different practising on your own to presenting to an audience, gather a group of your peers or family and friends and present to them.
This allows you to get a natural human reaction to your presentation and will help in making you more confident in front of a crowd.
You'll find that your worst mistakes will surface on your first run-throughs and you will have time to fix them.

* Time yourself: Once you have secured the content that you want to get across it is important to deliver it in the time frame you have.
Timing your presentation should be one of your last practice steps. Don't be afraid of removing content if you are going over, a well thought out talk is much more likely to resonate with your audience more than a rushed talk because you are trying to get more information crammed in.

## Maintain Precision

Precision in presenting research is paramount.
As researchers, we explore new concepts, developing knowledge, and pushing the edges of understanding.
Being precise in our presentation is essential to not only deliver the results of our research but to stop misinformation being spread as a result of accurate conclusions.

One way to stop our results being falsely reported on or misunderstood is to recognise how it could be interpreted.
Understanding this will give us the awareness we need to present the results of our research in a robust manner.

Discussed below are some techniques for identifying how you could be misrepresented.

### Common pitfalls

You are the expert in your results and you have the best understanding of the context.
You may already have laughed at similar work which has been wrongly reported.
Study these misrepresented reports.
Discover how the original work was taken out of context or presented unclearly; in other words, identify the common pitfalls.
You can then avoid falling into the same problem in how you present your results.

### Errors and uncertainties

In all areas of research, there are errors and uncertainties.
It is the nature of research and is a core part of implementing a robust methodology.
As such they should always be reported on and discussed.
Don't shy away from them, embrace them and explain them.

Not understanding how errors affect a result is a common problem in scientific reporting.
Presenting what your error boundaries are and what assumptions were made in the study is important, but equally important is explaining what the impact of the errors is on the result of the study and why those assumptions were made.
Don't be afraid to categorically say what your results do not say.

### Turning a negative into a positive

If something in which you have been involved has fallen to misinterpretation or false reporting don't just chalk it up to bad luck or experience.
You can turn a negative into a positive!

Don't be afraid to call out people for misrepresenting you or your work.
Take it as an opportunity to gain more exposure and correct the reporter.
Not only will this grow your credibility, but it will also deliver the truth that your research uncovered.
Your job is to make your message as understandable as possible for people who are willing to listen.

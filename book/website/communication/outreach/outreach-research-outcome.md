# Communicating Research Outcome

We should hold accountability to present our research work accurately and responsibly to convey correct results and avoid common misconceptions.
It is essential to demonstrate what scientific methods we use in our work. However, effectively presenting research outcomes is considered the most important component of a successful outreach effort.
Based on the type of audience we engage with, we can use different strategies to give unbiased and correct information.

## Consequences of Poor Outreach Efforts

We can publish our results on the most viewed website or highest renowned print media, but if we fail to communicate effectively or when we can't convey our message accurately, the consequence can be catastrophic.
For example, genuine breakthroughs should follow an enthusiastic exploration of published data and interest in collaboration. However, when we don't communicate them well, they fail to attract public attention, investors' interests, or lose funding and organisational support.

Over-hyped reporting of results is also damaging for science.
Speculative reporting of poorly understood information in popular media can conflate the possible impact decades worth of research have on society.

It may be tempting for early career researchers, to make their research sound more exciting for non-domain specialists or the general public.
Though there may be short-term benefits in terms of funding and visibility, constant under-delivery on the over-promised conclusions can create public mistrust and reduce the impact of valid scientific outcomes.
The accuracy of personal data is integral in scientific reporting that researchers should hold to the highest standards.

WIRED have a fantastic article, [The Life-Threatening Consequences of Overhyping AI](https://www.wired.com/story/the-life-threatening-consequences-of-overhyping-ai/), that breaks down how a popular news outlet did a selective reporting on a Nature article by giving evidence for only those times when the AI beat human doctors (and not the other way around.
Such misreporting has the potential to be dangerous and negatively affect peoples lives.

## Designing Research Project for Effective Outreach

In popular media, it is hard to always believe the latest headlines when "fake news" is rife.
With a little more care and attention, research can be robustly presented and a cultural shift can start to take place.

Two kinds of outreach that we should consider for planning a research project are preventative and symptomatic outreach.

### Preventative Outreach

It is about presenting so that your research can't be over-hyped or taken out of context to fuel someone else's agenda.
One of the best ways to do preventative outreach is to directly address what your research *does* and *doesn't* say.
Dispel any potential misinterpretations before they happen.

### Symptomatic Outreach

It is the other side of the equation, which is about addressing existing public misconceptions and overhype within our research.
Shying away from or ignoring current false reporting or misunderstandings of our research field is never going to fix the damage already done.
One great example of symptomatic outreach is the book "Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs" by Lisa Randall from Harvard University.
Randall published a paper on "[Dark Matter as a Trigger for Periodic Comet Impacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0576)", which was picked up by the media.
However, the media only covered a small humorous aside from her research, that dark matter could have played a role in killing the dinosaurs.
Randall took this misconception and used the catchy titles of the news articles as a jumping-off point for a much broader discussion on the nature of the Universe, dark matter, the Milky Way galaxy, comets, asteroids, and impacts.

## Presenting Results Responsibly

In the next subchapter, we provide practical tips and guidelines on how to present results responsibly to accurately convey research findings and avoid common miscommunication.

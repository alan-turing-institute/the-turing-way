# Becoming a science champion

The previous sections provide the best practices for doing outreach and to show how academic institutions can foster and promote outreach.
Individual efforts are still fundamental in changing the way science and evidence-based decision making is viewed and approached in society.

Every researcher should be an advocate for general scientific literacy in our organisations and the public.
This subchapter will discuss how we all have the responsibility to advocate for scientific literacy and the importance of evidence-based thinking.

From herd immunity going into dangerously low levels due to the anti-vaccine propaganda to climate change deniers occupying top offices in government, science denial has become a threat to our society and the future of our planet {cite}`Rosenau2012denial`.
Furthermore, at the moment the fields of data science and artificial intelligence are prone to hyperbole and hype that create misconceptions and over-expectations.

>*To overcome these threats, scientists not only need to spread scientific knowledge but must also address the social drivers of science denial.* - J. Rosenau, Science denial: a guide for scientists

In the following sub-sections, we will provide some ideas on how to assume this responsibility.
These recommendations come from either personal experiences or literature review from experts in science communication and outreach.

## Become an approachable scientist

Because science has its own secret language, it can be intimidating to the general public thus creating a myth around the idea of who a scientist is and what they do.
Some of the stereotypes are exacerbated by popular culture or the fact that researchers can be a rare species (according to UNESCO, in 2013 there were only 7.8 million full-time researchers in the world {cite}`UNESCO2020science`).
All this means that is our responsibility to demystify the typical idea of a scientist.

One first steps to becoming approachable are to understand that we are all at some level, science communicators, therefore we need to have decent communication skills.
A useful thing to have is the so-called "elevator pitch", wherein two minutes you try to sell you what you do for work to a neighbour, a family member or even potential employer.
An effective pitch can get people excited about science and even educate about the importance of public-funded research {cite}`Kwok2013comms`.
Whilst designing your pitch we need to have in mind who is our audience, avoid jargon and always aim for the big picture, as well as any other practices discussed in section 04.

One of the easiest ways to engage in outreach as an individual and become more approachable is to use your own social media profiles.
The typical individual scientistâ€™s social media audience is large and personally connected, allowing scientists to serve as a science advocate for their online friend and family networks.
Posting science-related news as well as sharing the process of doing science in your everyday life can be an easy way to keep interested colleagues, family, and friends informed about scientific topics.
Furthermore, in an era where fake news and alternate facts are common, scientists have the expertise to vet online content for scientific accuracy. Any scientist can quickly post a comment or share a link to correct misinformation in the news or on a conversation thread with minimal effort {cite}`Trevors2016knowledge`.

## Be an advocate for data and evidence  

Scientists are trained in the scientific method which promotes evidence over believe. This practice should not be restricted only to our research but used to all areas of our life.
When making decisions, consuming news or building opinions we must always consider all the available evidence and data.
Furthermore, we should be evangelists of this practice with the people around us.

Some of the small actions we can take in this direction:

* When discussing with family and friends, lead by example and use evidence to back up arguments.  
* Actively work with those closest to us to recognise false news,
* Have a curated pool of media sources with a high reputation for publishing data-driven confirmed information, share this with your close ones.
* Demand the media that you consume to include links to the data or original sources they discuss in their articles (for example, if they are talking about a scientific result they should link to the original paper).

Finally, we need to be extremely vigilant on our own sensitivity to confirmation bias (both in our lives and our research), this is the tendency to cherry-pick evidence that confirms our existing beliefs.
There are some techniques that you can use in order to reduce confirmation bias, for example, you can avoid forming a hypothesis too early when consuming new information, frequently ask yourself why your hypothesis might be wrong, or why alternative hypotheses might be right, finally always try to process new information in a conscious and unemotional manner {cite}`McClain2017fb`.

## Address science denial and disinformation

Fake news, alternative facts, although they are new terms in our vocabulary, they are not a new phenomenon but their dissemination has been accelerated by social media.
As scientists, we are drawn to denounce science deniers, by exposing them and providing scientific evidence to shows that they are wrong, but this might not be the most effective way to get people on our side.  

Research on the backfire effect phenomenon shows that when we are presented with facts and knowledge that threatens our self-conception and worldview, we tend to refuse to accept the facts and retreat further to our initial beliefs.

Whilst talking to a potential science denier, think about who is your audience to frame your message, a person that believes anti-vaccine propaganda, does not necessarily subscribe to the idea that human-made climate change is a hoax, they are not denying in all science, but just some part of it.
We must listen first to understand the mentality behind the denial and tailor our message accordingly. A popular technique from psychology that you could use can be summarized under the acronym EGRIP {cite}`Tsipursky2017book` (emotions, goals, rapport, information and positive reinforcement), you can find a detailed explanation in how to use it in this great article on ["How to Talk to a Science Denier without Arguing"](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/how-to-talk-to-a-science-denier-without-arguing/).

Finally, we must always remember that we are representing our institutions and science itself and that engaging into useless discussions with trolls, ridiculing 'non-believers' or struggling to communicate what we do in our jobs is not going to foster the trust that we need so badly to build up.

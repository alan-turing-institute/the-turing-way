# Integrating Outreach In Research Projects

> *Not only is it important to ask questions and find the answers, as a scientist I felt obligated to communicate with the world what we were learning.* â€• Stephen Hawking, Brief Answers to the Big Questions

We should design research projects with outreach as an integral aspect that has all administrative and technical resources available as necessary.
From engaging the public with scientific developments to increasing the visibility of our work, engaging in outreach can yield both personal and societal benefits.
While outreach is a multifaceted endeavour, all outreach activities are likely to require resources and funding.
At a minimum outreach requires a researcher's time and effort, a precious commodity in competitive research environments.
To ensure the personal and societal benefits of outreach are realised, it is vital that outreach is incentivised within scientific communities and the administrative resources required are available to researchers.

## Outreach as part of the research cycle

In UK Research and Innovation's (UKRI) *[conordat for engaging the public research](https://www.ukri.org/files/legacy/scisoc/concordatforengagingthepublicwithresearch-pdf/)*, Professor Alan Thorpe suggests that "...engaging with the public should form part of the role of researchers in any discipline".
To achieve this we believe that outreach should be viewed and resourced as part of the research cycle.
The resources required by outreach vary dramatically depending on the form the activities take.
Yet even seemingly small activities such as publishing a blog post, require researcher time and effort.

Ensuring outreach activities can be undertaken successfully requires that planning should begin before a project commences.
That is not to say that all outreach activities should be planned years in advance, as many ideas for outreach activities will form during the research project.
Rather, early planning can help ensure that resources are available to allow researchers the capacity to respond to valuable, yet unexpected outreach opportunities.
We advocate that 0it should become the expectation of a project to have an outreach output, whether it is known what form that is going to take at the project inception or not.

Whatever the career stage, early planning of outreach activities can be beneficial.
For senior staff, this may involve including outreach activities in funding applications (many research councils provide funding for outreach, and actively incentivise it).
For PhD students, it may involve discussing outreach opportunities with supervisors and setting realistic goals.

## Identify the target audience

When planning outreach it is important to consider who we want to engage with and why.
The reasons for doing outreach are varied and multifaceted.
We can publish a blog post on our latest research findings or a particular methodology we have been utilising.
We can also organise a meeting with potential end-users of our research to help steer future research questions, or give a public lecture on our research area.
It's important to remember that outreach is a two-way activity - both an opportunity to inform the public and to learn from them.
Understanding our own goals and the likely benefits of the outreach activity are critical in maximising their value.
Give personal goals prominence and consider how outreach may aid your career, both within your current institute and future places of work.
While outreach can yield a wide variety of societal benefits, personal benefits may play an important role in incentivising outreach activities.
This may simply be building our research profile and CV, but it may be useful to consider how outreach activities are rewarded within our institution.

## Identify resources and define realistic goals

Identifying resource requirements can help to ensure that outreach goals are appropriate and realistic.
Remember that not all outreach activities are appropriate for all goals.
Wasting resources, time and money (both your own and others) is not desirable and in certain circumstances could even lead to reputational damage.
Consider time as a key resource - does your workload allow for outreach activities, and how might you ensure you are able to achieve your goals to a standard you are proud of?

Consider whether you or your team have the expertise to carry out the activities.
This may include both technical research expertise as well as project management, public speaking, organisation, and financial management.
Finding out what help and support is available at your Institute can be particularly useful.
Many provide training opportunities to aid with outreach activities, in addition to having communications and media engagement teams who can offer expertise to maximise your research impact.
In addition, Universities may also hold internal funds for outreach.
For example, in the UK, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) have provided impact acceleration grants to several Universities, specifically to support outreach, and other funding sources may be available (see [ESRC Impact acceleration grants](https://esrc.ukri.org/collaboration/collaboration-oportunities/impact-acceleration-accounts/)).

## Measure success and share experiences

Much like evaluation, any other part of the research cycle, evaluating outreach success can help to identify shortcomings and refine the approach taken.
Thinking about how success will be measured can be useful during the planning out outreach activities and should be closely tied to the goals outreach goals.
Consider whether the goals were achieved and identify challenges that arose.
Evaluation can consist of simple reflection and discussion with team members, but more formal methods such as questionnaires and feedback forms can also be valuable, particularly for assessing public perceptions of the activity.
For activities such as blog writing or press releases, it is often possible to gather metrics on audience reach, such as the number of people reading a post.

# Motivation and Background

Most of the content in the Turing Way Book is aimed at improving practices in our research to ensure that our research work is accessible and reproducible by others.
Methods, tools and practices discussed in this book will help enhance the impact of our research can have in different fields.
It is useful to remember that the scope of research impact includes the benefits our work can have in our society, therefore, we should be able to communicate them to the public.
Unfortunately, only a handful of researchers invest the required time and effort into outreach, which often leads to an inaccurate representation of research outcome in the media, misinformation in public or inhibot important results from getting the required attention.
Research funding ultimately depend on projects making beneficial contributions to society, and an ability to communicate these impacts to the public and elected officials will help ensure continued funding for research in the future.

This chapter focuses on best practices for outreach and communication to ensure that our research has a broader impact outside of our immediate field.
This is a challenging task, as communicating complex results effectively to a non-expert takes practice - skill that is often not taught properly as part of the training that most researchers receive..
Outreach involves presenting the big picture results without necessarily going into the details that we might find interesting as a researcher, developing relationships with people that can help disseminate our research, and advocate for data literacy in general within and outside of our institution.
Ultimately, we should promote the use of outreach tools for engagement with the general public and experts from different fields

## Fundamental Principles

Researchers can use these principles when undertaking the responsibilities of doing outreach for their work:
1. We should present results accurately and responsibly to convey research findings and avoid common misconceptions.
2. We should communicate and coordinate effectively with different audiences such as journalists, general public, industry, and other data scientists, in an accessible and diverse way.
3. We should approach projects with the expectation that outreach is an integral part, providing the administrative resources necessary to facilitate its activities.
4. We should develop an organic relationship with other people involved in communications and information brokering by providing training, collaborating and coordinating.
5. We should be advocates for general scientific literacy in our organisations and the public.

## Complementing Outreach with Research Work

The reasons for doing outreach are various, from career enhancement, skills development to the pure joy of sharing knowledge.
No matter the reason, here are a few ways one can complement their research cycle with outreach activities:

* Help the public gain a general understanding of scientific concepts and inspire the next generations to pursue a career in research.
* Outreach activities can help convince the public that your research matters and why governments (and hence the taxpayer) should support it {cite}`Ranganathan2013Outreach`.
* The effort of explaining your research in simple terms compells us to see the big picture and prioritise what is important.
This exercise of abstraction can positively impact the view of our work as a researcher.
* Outreach is an excellent opportunity to practice and improve communication skills.
This is particularly valuable for early career researchers, as advancing their career depends on communicating how they can deliver impactful research {cite}`UniBath2019Outreach`.
* Participating in outreach activities can raise researchers' profiles and improve career opportunities.
* There is a crisis of public trust in science, with very vocal anti-science movements in debates around high profile issues such as vaccines {cite}`BBCNews2015antivax`, climate change {cite}`Feder2012climate`, and other fields involving expert knowledge {cite}`LSE2019trustcrisis`.
It is our duty as researchers to fight misinformation by making our research approachable and understandable to the public.

We hope that the material described in this chapter will help you become an advocate for your research and ensure that your work has a maximal impact.

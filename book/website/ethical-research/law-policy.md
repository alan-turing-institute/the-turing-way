# Law, Policy and Human Rights in Ethics

## Summary
Law, human rights and policy all relate to ethics, but they are not the same thing.

You should be aware of the laws and policies that apply to you and your work.
However, this is not sufficient to ensure that your work is ethical. 

Human rights provide a legal framework for protecting individuals. 
However, this framework operates at national and international level.
Ethical work should be grounded in human rights, but sometimes require more guidance to operationalise for particular contexts.

Laws and policies are made by people, and they are subject to negotiations and exercises of power: they can also be changed.

## Background and Motivation

It's useful to know how the ethics that guide your work are underpinned by other frameworks, including law, policy, and human rights. 
Knowing the law, policy, and human rights that underpin research ethics will give you a deeper understanding of how to conduct ethical research. 
It can also help you to advocate for ethical work with colleagues and collaborators.

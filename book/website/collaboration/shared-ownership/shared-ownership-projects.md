# Project Ownership

Before we unpack how a project's shared ownership affects research software’s sustainability, let’s define what we mean by ownership.
If the software is shared without any license, it is assumed to be copyright by default, meaning, only the author can decide who can use the code.
Therefore, the best practice to share software is to add an open source license defining the way the existing codebase can be used and shared.

An open source project is more than just the code and documents.
A major part of a project is about the people involved, how they interact and share responsibilities, and how they are recognised for their contributions -- none of which are regulated by the license. By defining the project ownership, we can address these concerns, going beyond the software license itself.

Similar to the copyright default of software, if ownership in a project is not defined, it is not shared ownership.
Shared ownership for an Open source project should include the following aspects:
- ***Who** are the project contributors?*
Contributors can be individuals, developer/research teams or institutes.
These contributors can be paid members of the project or volunteers contributing in their own time.
- ***What** motivates them to collaborate and contribute, and what their contributions look like?*
Contributors are often interested in addressing the problem as the open project they contribute to or have some shared interest in developing the project, personal skills or practices.
- ***How** are they recognised for their contributions?*
This includes the culture of openly acknowledging contributions made by individuals in an informal way (internal and social communication) and formal manner like by adding contributors as authors in their publication, project repository and latest release to give visibility outside the project.
- ***Why** will they take responsibilities and accountability as a contributor to the project?*
For a project to truly belong to a community, it is crucial to define why contributors will be excited to be a part of the project.
For example, they are provided with roles and opportunities to make meaningful contributions.
- ***Where** can they learn about the project ownership in detail?*
This should be openly shared in a document (or set of documents) that are easy to find and can be easily understood by its readers.
Details will depend on the scale of the project, but the model of shared ownership with pathways for contributors roles and rewards should be clearly defined.

# Virtual Onboarding


Joining a new group virtually is a very different experience from joining in person, and it can be hard to know if someone is struggling or isolated.  

You can help to make this experience less overwhelming by having a clear onboarding plan and resources.

This should include an introduction to the team, an ongoing support mechanism for the new team member and onboarding documents.

## Introducing the Team

It can be intimidating to be the first to speak as a new member - consider asking your team to introduce themselves first in meetings. Initial introductions could be part of the role of a buddy (see below).

Names and roles are also easy to forget, particularly if we aren't seeing people in the office every day.
It can be helpful to store this information somewhere, for example, by sending around an introductory or onboarding email.
Also consider organising online social events, such as coffee chats or team activity like a video game or escape room, to help new members integrate into the group.

An onboarding event sharing important information like contact details, organigram, shared calendar, resources available to everyone, organisation policy and social norms can be extremely useful.

## Support

You can provide one-on-one support - such as a buddy for informal peer support, or a mentor, for more formal support. You may provide more than one buddy to take the pressure off individual relationships and also so that a remote-starter immediately meets another person.

This helps the new joiner understand group norms, and allows them to ask any sensitive questions they wouldn't like to raise in a group discussion.

You should consider that the buddy or mentor should remain for a longer period than would be needed with in person onboarding. 

To help keep an informal relationship you may want to ensure that the buddy is not the line manager or collaborating with the new-starter on their first piece of work.

Co-working with a buddy or several team members is another informal way to build relationships with new team members and is an informal environment to address any questions that may have arisen in the first few days or weeks of employment.

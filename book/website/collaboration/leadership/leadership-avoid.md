## Conflicts of interest 

Conflict of interest will arise when in leadership positions, be aware. If a person leads several projects that may overlap, they should keep them separate and well compartmentalized.

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQjRnWVmL28), Carol Willing explains how it is critical to abstain from decisions as a leader when you have a conflict of interest.

## Trying to be a leader everywhere

The same person should not be a leader everywhere. People in one or several lead positions would ideally leave room for others to take on leadership positions. 

Good leadership takes a lot of time. It is often not possible to lead well if leading several projects. Leadership and limited time allocation are often incompatible.

## Nurturing the next leaders

Leaders ought to nurture a group of people from diverse backgrounds and levels around them. This group will become the next leaders after some reasonable time. 

Such a group will also be a trusted source of changes and updates in data science domains. 

When too busy leading, leaders will run out of time to learn about the latest advances both at technical and human levels.  This team keeps leaders from different blind spots and allows the projects led to transform accordingly.

Blind spots are particularly challenging in multicultural, sometimes even globally-distributed teams.

## Offboarding gracefully

Offboarding leaders gracefully, maybe using a guide, so they can step down if needed. Allow leaders to step down before they burn out.

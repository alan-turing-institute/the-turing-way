# Onboarding New Members


## Background and Motivation
Onboarding is the process of welcoming new team or community members through a set of structured interactions and materials that supports their interaction with the project. 
As any initiative grows or welcomes new cohorts of membership, a thoughtful onboarding process plays a critical role in maintaining a healthy, active, and inclusive community. 

Good onboarding process has several benefits: 
1. Helps team members feel part of the team and starts building connections within the team and wider community
2. Empowers the team member to get up to speed and start contributing faster 
3. Ensures that team members have access to the resources and information they need, reducing the work of community managers in the medium-long term 
4. Supports sustainable engagement with a project, helping people become regular contributors 
5. Clear communication of policies and ways to working at the beginning establishes the team or community norms and best practices, helping to avoid misunderstandings, and maintaining a positive culture

## Key components of onboarding 

Onboarding processes and structures will vary depending on the needs of the project, the types of people who participate, and the frequency that new contributors join. 
However, when thinking about designing onboarding, there are several areas to consider covering: 
> [name=Malvika] Several of these points are covered in the doc that Becki, Aida and Isabel wrote, maybe merge this with their draft of subchapter?
*	A clear document or a README page with links to relevant materials and meetings if your project is hosted on GitHub 
* Strategic materials that clearly spell out the aims of the project/programme/initiative (such as project introduction slides, programme 1-pager) 
> [name=Malvika Sharan] Not sure what strategic materials is? Are there different name for that?
* Reference materials that explain where to find information, how to ask for help, and governance such as the code of conduct 
* Training materials or sessions covering tools and systems used by the project 
* Regular or one-off sessions dedicated to newer members where they can ask questions or be walked through the contributing process 
* Deliberate connections between new and more experienced members about their roles or specific aspects of the project


It may also be useful to connect onboarding process content to {ref}`Personas and Pathways to contribution<pd-persona>` for a project if these have been mapped, to help with introducing the different ways people might contribute. 
Onboarding doesn’t have to provide an exhaustive list of every single way to participate, but it should give people the knowledge and tools they need to find out more about the areas that interest them. 


## Planning onboarding
> [name=Malvika Sharan] this should be moved to the subchapter that the group wrote, or even split that subchapter into two based on grouped topics that go well together

At the end of onboarding, new team members should have a strong idea of: 
* How the team interacts and its working patterns (e.g. meetings, communication channels, file storage, review processes) 
* Where to find policies, procedures, codes of conduct, and other information about the project 
* Which tools are used by the project and how to find out more about how to use them 
* How and where to ask questions 
* Opportunities to get involved more deeply in the project or community 


You should plan out your onboarding process to take each of these things into account. 
It’s also useful to make the onboarding process transparent, such as storing materials in a dedicated folder in the project repository, so that it’s easier to scale, have someone else lead the onboarding, or to identify missing sections through feedback from the community. 

Onboarding in-person or virtually can raise different challenges and things to consider. 
The Virtual Onboarding chapter covers online onboarding in more detail.

# Onboarding New Members


# Onboarding - why is it important? 


## Background and Motivation
Onboarding is the process of welcoming new team or community members through a set of structured interactions and materials that supports their interaction with the project. 
As any initiative grows or welcomes new cohorts of membership, a thoughtful onboarding process plays a critical role in maintaining a healthy, active, and inclusive community. 

Good onboarding process has several benefits: 
1. Helps team members feel part of the team and starts building connections within the team and wider community
2. Empowers the team member to get up to speed and start contributing faster 
3. Ensures that team members have access to the resources and information they need, reducing the work of community managers in the medium-long term

5. Clear communication of policies and ways to working at the beginning establishes the team or community norms and best practices, helping to avoid misunderstandings, and maintaining a positive culture

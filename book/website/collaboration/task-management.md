### Task management

Content/draft for issue https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1436

TODO some text here on why this is important for reproducible data science teams. 


## Contents

* What is a task - levels of abstraction
* What is a good format and size of a task
* Where should tasks "live"
* Systems like GTD, Kanban
* Planning, setting priorities (and avoiding overwhelm)
* How to communicate this with team members

There are some similarities here to creating Github issues, but this idea is more general and focuses more on conventions/agreements with team members, than on working with specific tools.

Most of the text below is from Veronika's blog and will need to be edited / reorganized.


## What is a task 

There are different levels at which tasks exist - at the lowest level tasks can be done in a few minutes, and at the highest level tasks are actually projects, which again have tasks.

### Defining tasks

* Use a verb
* What is done

### Sorting tasks 

To decide if and when to do a task, you need more information about the task, such as date and if needed, tags. Tags can be related to:

* Priority, for example Eisenhower matrix (urgent/important) 
* What tools you need for the task (for example internet) 
* How long you estimate the task will take (minutes/hours/...) 
* What is the effort involved (high/low) 

### Kanban

Not a system but more a philosophy. Kanban principle, originates from building cars. The idea behind Kanban is to “manage work by balancing demands with available capacity” (Wikipedia). The goal is to not do too many things at the same time, and finish first what you started working on. 

Tasks (but also projects) progress from left to right in time, for example: 

* Backlog/ideas
* Next
* Doing
* Done
* Dropped

### Doing tasks

* Put the task on your calendar
* Pomodoro
* "Eat The Frog"


## Systems / project "pulse"

Switching between managing and doing - assuming you are a team member yourself. How often do you check in with the whole team, when do you plan things, when do you evaluate results. 

### GTD

Getting Things Done by David Allen, approach to task management initially intended for individuals, although the principles can be applied more broadly. Overall it comes down to two steps:

* Capture - as soon as something comes up, put it inside your system 
* Process - sort and organize your tasks so that you know what you need to focus on next. This can be done at different levels, but an important one is every week, also called weekly review, during which you sit down and go through a checklist.  


### Scrum

Type of process frequently used in software development (more background here). Traditionally in this process, a team is working on the same project. Sprint every two weeks, plan tasks, do tasks using scrum board. Every day stand-up to see if there are any issues, who needs to help whom, 15 minutes. Retrospectives to evaluate. 

In a research setting this might be less applicable if each person is working on their own project, and the timing might be slower due to experiments, for example. However principles can still be adapted to a research setting, examples:

## Tools 

You need:

* Calendar (shared)
* Task list
* Reference
* Communication channel

Various tools integrate one of more of these. 

Calendar - many choices, Google Calendar is popular
List - Todoist, Notion, many others. Some have Kanban functionality like Trello, Todoist, Github Boards, Notion. 
Reference - Github (via Issues), Notion, Evernote, Google Drive, Dropbox
Communication - Slack, Todoist (via comments), Github (via Issues), Evernote (via chat) (there is already a chapter on this, link to it for more details) 

Some apps allow integrations with others, if not it is often possible to set up via IFTTT or Zapier. 

### Shared calendar

Group meetings, time slots, when are people doing what (if you need their help) 

### Shared reference

Don't duplicate the work of saving important documents (templates, reports). For example research papers:

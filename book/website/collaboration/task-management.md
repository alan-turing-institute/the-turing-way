### Task management

Content/draft for issue https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1436

TODO some text here on why this is important for reproducible data science teams. 


## Contents

* What is a task - levels of abstraction
* What is a good format and size of a task
* Where should tasks "live"
* Systems like GTD, Kanban
* Planning, setting priorities (and avoiding overwhelm)
* How to communicate this with team members

There are some similarities here to creating Github issues, but this idea is more general and focuses more on conventions/agreements with team members, than on working with specific tools.

Most of the text below is from Veronika's blog and will need to be edited / reorganized.


## What is a task 

There are different levels at which tasks exist - at the lowest level tasks can be done in a few minutes, and at the highest level tasks are actually projects, which again have tasks.

### Defining tasks

* Use a verb
* What is done


## Systems

### GTD

Getting Things Done

### Kanban

### Scrum

## Tools

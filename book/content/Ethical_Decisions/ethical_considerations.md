# Ethical considerations

## What is ethics: The basics

### A "simple" definition of "ethics"
    
"Ethics" is often mentioned in the news lately, especially in relation to digital technologies and data science used by big tech companies. You may be curious as to what 'ethics' actually means. Since it's the 21st century, we will try to give you a 5-minute definition of this more than two millenia old tradition (because nobody has time for that, right?).

*Ethics* is the branch of philosophy that deals with *moral principles*. In a nutshell, it is about identifying maxims to guide our actions in the world so that they are "right" and do not contradict the social norms that hold society together. 

Of course, within ethics there are many perspectives: ethics is *universal* (the same for everybody), there is an ethic for every *culture* (the same for everybody in a specific cultural context), ethics is *individual* (everybody has a different ethical system), etc. We could not possible address all of these traditions here. However, a good starting point is to consider some questions traditionally linked to ethics in philosophy:

- Is there a meaning to life? When is a life "worth"? Are some lives worth more than others? 
- Is it right to dedicate one's life to obtaining pleasure? Or should life be a sacrifice?
- Are there sacred things that cannot be violated? (e.g., identity)
- Are there limits to individual action? Who should seet up those limits, if they exist?
- Does the end justify the means? Is there a single answer to this question? Does it depend on the end? Or does it depend on the means? 

Ethics may so far sound like a distant discipline to the researcher. However, we actually deal with the classic questions of ethics on a daily basis. Consider the following cases and questions:

- Clinical psychologists research how to improve people's mental health... Who defines what is healthy? Is "living healthy" synonymous with "living well"? Does a psychologist have the right to say anything about another person's mental health? 
- Developmental psychologists could design an experiment in which a group of babies are deprived of their mother's love in order to learn more about their emotional abilities (a field in which much more evidence is needed!)... Would this be morally acceptable if the experiment lasted an hour? And if it lasted a day/a week? 
- One group of scientists is certain that they could achieve a cure for cancer, but to do so they would have to give a group of patients a drug that could kill them instantly... Would it be right to proceed with the clinical trial?

In each and every one of these cases, investigators are faced with ethical dilemmas. These dilemmas often take the form of "what I want/can do" vs. "what I should do". And for every dilemma, there is a decision the investigator must make to resolve it. 

It is important to note that all decisions made by scientists in the context of research have ethical consequences. Philosophers refer to this as "ethical supervening". To put it simply: it cannot happen that scientists make changes to a research design without this having ethical effects. Conducting an experiment in one way rather than another, sharing certain data or not doing so, opting for one type of data analysis rather than another... since all these choices can lead to chains of potentially harmful effects, they can be analysed through the prism of values (ethics!).  

**'Rule-of-thumb' ethics**

In the field of scientific research, ethics is all about the:

> (...) identification and articulation of principles intended to promote good and minimise harm (Luger & Rodden, 2020, p. 149)

The goal of ethics is the humble task to help us know what is 'good' and how to be 'good'. There are no quick and easy fixes for that. Especially for data scientists who may feel removed and distanced from people that their actions impact, such as people whose data you use, people reusing the data you collected or people relying on your research. But that's a lot of responsibility. So what should you think about?

There are a variety of ethical frameworks that exist and continue to be created, but they are all grounded in two main streams of thinking - bioethics and human rights. Knowing those basics should serve you as a helpful 'rule-of-thumb' mental checklist that you can think about, though this is by no means extensive and, as with good science, the deeper you go, the more complex it gets.

>[European Textbook on Ethics in Research](http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/document_library/pdf_06/textbook-on-ethics-report_en.pdf)

**Bioethics**
The history of bioethics is grounded in some wildly unethical medical research that took place in the early part of the 20th century (see for example the [Tuskegee syphilis experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment). In response to that, some very smart people publisehd [The Belmont Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Report) which helped crystalise the core principles of bioethics and conducting research with humans that still help guide research today.

- **Respect for persons** 
- **Beneficence (and non-maleficence)**
- **Justice**

Three primary areas of application of these core bioethics principles are also stated. Below we summarise them and give examples of how they might apply to data science. 
- **Informed consent**
- **Assessment of risks and benefits**
- **Selection of subjects** 

>**Resources**:
> [Principles of bioethics](https://depts.washington.edu/bhdept/ethics-medicine/bioethics-topics/articles/principles-bioethics)

**Human rights**
Human rights found their beginnings after the world faced the horrors and aftermath of World War II. Motivated to prevent such dehumanisation and hatred from arising again, countries united and made political (and legally enforceable) commitments to human rights. 

Human rights are claims that all individuals have by the virtue of being human. Human rights arise as a result of the dignity of individual persons and seek to protect individuals against political, legal, and social abuse. They apply to all people all over the world. Beyond being legally enforceable claims, human rights are also believed to be ethical values that demand protection because humans are owed respect of their dignity. To get lost in the philosophy of human rights, [click here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights-human/).

Human rights that may be relevant to data-driven research are:
- right to respect (non-intrusion) into a person's privacy, family, home or correspondence
- freedom of opinion and expression 
- freedom of thought, conscience and religion
- right to life 
- right to a healthy environment

> **As a rule of thumb**
> As a best practice, privacy considerations should enter the very development of your research plan and should be considered at every step of your research. **Think about how to minimise your interference with the private lives and information of others.**


## Why should data scientists (or any scientists) care about ethics? 
-

* Sometimes ethics is seen as a bureaucratic requirement researchers have to meet in order to conduct the "real research"
* Alternatively, it is used as a excuse for not opening or sharing data, without examining why this is the case. 
* Are data scientists adequately represented on ethics boards?
- Ethics can help you carry out better data science. A lot of requirements related to ethics are also requirements of good data science in general 



## Ethics and law are different things (but sometimes they look very similar) 

Ethics and law are different things. It can sometimes be confusing to think about the difference, especially as a researcher.

**Ethics** is about what we *should* do to be 'good' where what 'good' means and how to achieve it is a long-standing topic of philosophical discussion (and a great topic to cover over a beer). We gave you some "rule-of-thumb" kind of tips above, but of course, there are rich resources available about being an ethical researcher.

**Law** instead are the rules and requirements that a society (and legitimate and accountable bodies) have decided are good, reasonable, and desirable for the public. Because these rules have been agreed in this way, they can also be enforced in a court or tribunal or by a public authority and someone can be helpd responsible, liable, they can be *made* to do (or not do) something or *made* to pay a cost.

> Acting legally does not mean that you will act ethically. But acting ethically requires you, among other things, to act legally. 

In data science research, the difference between ethics and law could become tricky when thinking about privacy and data protection law. **Privacy is an ethical value** that is linked to a person's autonomy - people have the right to decide who knows what about them, how they are perceived publicly, and who interferes with their private lives. But **privacy is also a legally protected right**, because society and law-making bodies have agreed it is so important and fundamental that it deserves enforceable protection. Privacy is protected in many documents, including:
- The UN International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights
- The European Convention of Human Rights
- The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Many national constitutions and laws

Many ethical requirements related to privacy are so important that they are also legal requirements in certain circumstances. This means that they are **not  optional**. For example:
- Getting informed consent from research participants is an ethical requirement in bioethics (see above) but it is also one of a few legal requirements for processing personal data in the GDPR (See [Article 6 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/))
- Carrying out an impact assessment of risks and benefits is an ethical requirement in bioethics (see above) but it is carrying out a data protection impact assessment is also a legal requirement where you process personal data using novel technology or where you are likely to have an impact (See [Article 35 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/))

**Be careful not to confuse your legal obligations for ethical recommendations. Every country has its own set of relevant laws and regulations on how data is recorded, used, managed, shared. It is your responsibility to ensure you comply with the law.**




## Examples of common questions that researchers have with regard to ethics - don't panic! 
- 

> What should I do to access data?
> What consistutes "informed" consent? (see accessing data below)
> What can be open and what should stay private? (see data management below)
> What should I do with data once I have it? (See data management below)
> How do I balance reproducible research and open science with people's privacy?

## Reusing data

Reusing data, even when it is data from the public domain, comes with a set of ethical and legal considerations that you need to keep in mind.

### GDPR - A Brief Note 


---
*Note that the following is intended as an introduction to GDPR **only** and should not be considered legal advice. If you are planning a study that uses human data please speak to your research ethics or legal team for their recommendations around GDPR compliance.*
### What is GDPR?
* The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a piece of European Union (EU) legislation, which went into force in May 2018, 
* It is designed to give people greater control over the personal data held on them by organisations and have a say in what they use it for 
* It is also intended to place more emphasis on the responsible use of personal data by organisations 
* **Personal data** includes any information which could potentially be used to identify an individual (e.g. IP address, name, bank account number) in the context of the other data you hold 
    * For example, someone's data of birth may not be considered an identifier on its own, but combined with a postcode it could enable them to be identified 
    * Information which has had identifiers removed or replaced in order to pseudonymise the data is still personal data for the purposes of GDPR (if the data is *truly anonymous* then GDPR does not apply)
* The GDPR also put clearer guidelines around organisers/people who hold data (controllers) or who process data (processors) and their responsibilities
    * **Controllers** decide what data is to be collected from whom and are responsible for storing the data securely as well as managing individual requests for data access (e.g. UK BioBank)
    * **Processors** work with data but do not determine what data is collected, although they may still be responsible for maintaining the security of the data (e.g. researchers working with UK BioBank)
    * [Here's a brief guide and checklist to determine whether you might be a data controller or a data processor](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/controllers-and-processors/)

### What does GDPR mean? 

* Organisations now need to tell people upfront: 
- [ ] What data they are collecting on an individual 
- [ ] What they will use the data for 
- [ ] Who they will share data with 

* They also need to 
- [ ] Only collect data for a specific purpose
- [ ] Only collect data that is ncessary for the original purpose
- [ ] Not retain data for longer than is necessary 
- [ ] Make efforts to keep records up to date
- [ ] Keep data secure
- [ ] Allow individuals the right to view their data, have it corrected, or deleted

* There are many reasons why organisations might collect someones personal data, but they need to be able to justify them according to the GDPR definitions 
    * For researchers, this means obtaining **explicit consent** from individuals, or demonstrating **legitimate interests** for using the data

* In practice, complying with GDPR needs to be in built into data collection processes from the beginning 
### Who does it apply to?
* The GDPR covers all organisations that hold data in the EU and *all* EU citizens, regardless of where they are located
    * For example, a US website that uses tracking cookies which can be accessed by EU citizens needs to comply with GDPR 
    * For example, an EU citizen in India or the US is covered by GDPR
### Why should researchers care?
* **Failure to comply with GDPR requirements can result in fines for your organisation!** 
* A large proportion of scientists collect human data as a routine part of their work. An even larger proportion include some human data, so data protection regulations are likely to apply 
* Since GDPR regulations cover EU citizens regardless of their location, scientists working with them, or who are based in the EU, need to comply 
* There may be other data protection laws which are relevant to your study and impact on the way you are able to collect, analyse, store, or publish data, depending on where you are planning your study
### How might it work with reusing data in science? 
If in doubt, **consult a professional at your organisation** 
#### If you are planning to access data
* Increasingly, scientists are accessing data which was not collected specifically for their study, such as tweets, genetic data sets, patient cohorts, or healthcare records 

* Depending on when the data were collected 

* Check the original consent form if at all possible and confirm:
    * Did participants consent to sharing of the data with other researchers for different analyses? 
    * Did they consent to follow up / recontact to update their data or collect additional data? 
    * How long was the data supposed to be kept for? 

#### If you are planning to share data 
* 
### Checklist for data statements 
If in doubt, **consult a professional at your organisation**

Below is a quick checklist for when you're planning your data collection for your own research study - it may also be useful in writing data statements which should be included on any consent forms used with individuals 

This is not an exhaustive list! Not all of this will need to be included in a data statement, but the information should be clearly and freely available to participants.  

Remember, plans for keeping the data secure and allowing individuals to access it need to be **robust** - if you win the lottery and move to a private island will the processes still work? 

### Research Data Planning and Data Statement Checklist
- [ ] What data will you be collecting from an individual? 
- [ ] Why you are collecting the type of data you are asking for?
- [ ] What is the *lawful basis* under which you are collecting this data? 
- [ ] How will the data be used and who will it be shared with?
- [ ] What outputs will the data contribute to? In what format? 
- [ ] Can people find out how long you will keep the data for?
- [ ] What is the process for them to contact you or your organisation if they want to request their data, correct their data, or have their data deleted? 
    - [ ] *Will this process still work if you win the lottery and quit your job?*
- [ ] Will you be sharing their data with third parties in the EU? 
- [ ] Will you be sharing their data their data with third parties outside the EU?  
- [ ] How will you keep their personal data secure? 
    - [ ] *Will this process still work if you win the lottery and quit your job?*

## Reusing data from data repositories and web scraping

If you are reusing information from database repositories or other similar platforms, always ensure your research is in line with their Terms of Service and respect the appropriate IP rights of the creators of the databases.

If you are using information that you access through APIs, make sure that all your activities comply with the Terms of Service of the website you are using.

If you collect data using webscraping tools, ensure that your scraping does not go against the consent of the creators and owners of the website.
- read the robots.txt file on the website and make sure that the page you are trying to scape has not prohibited scraping and crawlers
- consult the Terms of service of the website to figure out for what purposes scraping is allowed (your purpose would be research)
- carry out the scraping in a way that does not harm the website or result in denial of service to other website visitors

## Open data and data management
Benefits of doing this rather than reusing data
* Patient and Public Involvement - doing research WITH stakeholders (i.e. patients) rather than ABOUT them (there's a section on this in the book already but might need reworking/expanding and potentially linking/moving to this chapter)
* Working with marginalised groups - I think it would be worth explicitly discussing ethical considerations around this area as part of the section above (for example, I'm thinking of indigenous groups or those who have been historically mistreated by scientists)
* How to bring those who have not traditionally been part of the scientific discussion into research as experts of lived experience who can advise on research goals and ethical issues (e.g. as above, indigenous groups, patients)
* Considering the impact of studies and experiments on the environment 

**Note**: There is some existing stuff on citizen science, inclusion, equity etc in the [Open Scholarship](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/open_research/06/openscholarship.html#equity-diversity-inclusion) section of the book 

How to?
- The ethics behind it: autonomy, beneficence...
- Shout out to GDPR *It's law not ethics but it will impact on the types of research and data and people need to be aware of it when they design studies* (and a note on laws differing by country/area)

**Collecting data from human participants**
(*not priority because less common in data science?*) Even if a researcher does not directly collect data from a person, much of the data we use in data science originated from human sources. Once they are anonymised, or made public, measures of behaviour or biology become disembodied to data scientists, but we should remain aware when the source of our data is the human lived experience.

Consent guides the collection and use of data. Ethical approval of research involving human participants typically requires some level of *informed consent*. In the case of medical research involving human participants, the [Declaration of Helsinki](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/) codifies ethical principles premised on individual self-determination and the ability to grant and withdraw consent to research with clear, publicly available aims.

The Declaration of Helsinki adopted and modified [The Neuremberg Code](/https://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/nuremberg.pdf), drawn up in response to the Neuremberg Trials for atrocities of the Second World War. The first line of the Code addressed consent.
> 1. The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential
- As computation and consolidataion of data allowed for new research models and analysis the Declaration of Helsinki was augmented by the [Declaration of Taipai](/https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-taipei-on-ethical-considerations-regarding-health-databases-and-biobanks/) which set guiding ethical principles to balance respect to individuals with the benefits of large scale health data as a contribution to shared human knowledge.


**Note**: there is a section on [barriers to open data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/open_research/01/opendata.html#barriers-to-data-sharing) in the book already which might be useful

### Consent from individuals
If you collect your original primary data, you carry the responsibility of putting appropriate consent procedures in place that would allow you to carry out your research and, where possible and appropriate, would also allow you to further share your research data, making your research transparent and reproducible.

If you reuse existing information, it is your responsibility to ensure that, when the information was first collected, it received the appropriate consent to allow it to be reused for research purposes.

# Demonstrating your work is ethical


## Ways to demonstrate and monitor ethical research
- Make ethical principles, frameworks and policies visible by including them on project webpage(s). In some cases this may be a legal requirement (e.g. if you are collecting personal data).
- Schedule ethics monitoring in your project workplan to ensure your research is continually compliant. 
- Make provisions to maintain compliance even after the project end date - e.g. if you have committed to retain data for a maximum of 3 years establish a process to ensure this is deleted even if you are working elsewhere.

## Ethics & Funder Requirements

The vast majority of research funding organisations require researchers to demonstrate good ethical practice and compliance at all stages of the project lifecycle.

Many funding application systems will trigger requests for ethics declarations under certain circumstances – for example if research involves personal data processing or clinical trials. Regardless, it is important to show awareness of and commitment to responsible and ethical research throughout any project proposal.

Funders may impose the following methods for ethics monitoring and compliance:

- Request an ethics self-assessment
- Conduct a formal pre-project ethics review
- Perform an ethics audit during or after the completion of a project

## Institutional frameworks & policies

- Institutions may hold a number of policies and statements with relevance to ethical practice. These could include:
    - Ethics
    - Data Privacy / Processing / Protection
    - Information Management
    - Equality, Diversity & Inclusion
    - Safeguarding

- Ethics committees
    - Depending on your project size, you wish or be required to set up a project-specific ethics committee, in addition to institutional ethics boards

### Ethics in collaborations

Projects that collaborate across institutions and international borders may face particular challenges with regards to differing or conflicting legislation.

## Case study

### How "open" can you be? Researching cognitive development with babies.

Two years ago, the research team of which I am a member received a grant to study certain cognitive developmental processes (i.e., perception, gestures, executive functions, conceptual thinking) in babies between 1 and 17 months of age, at the Infant School in Spain.

This was a wonderful opportunity, as funding is rarely available to investigate how cognitive development occurs in early childhood in ecological and everyday contexts (most research in the field is done in laboratories through experiments!).

Data collection was mainly done through non-participatory observation and video recording and analysis (i.e., behavioural information). Gathering this kind of data is a Herculean task: it takes a lot of time and requires a lot of effort. To give you an idea, we went to the Infant School to record once every 21 days, 6 hours each day, for 18 months in a row. 

By that time, I was already an Open Science advocator, and I was very actively trying to get my research colleagues to adopt more open practices. 

We were then faced with an ethical dilemma: 
1. We wanted other people to benefit from the effort that we had put into collecting data. 
2. We wanted to share our data in an open repository, to spur *reproducibility* and *robustness* (see [Chapter 2.3](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/reproducibility/03/definitions.html)).
3. We wanted to comply with *FAIR data principles* (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable data). 
4. We had to be GDPR compliant. 

Of course, this wasn't going to be easy: point 4 seemed to got along badly with all the others. It was clear that the only possibility of getting close to fulfilling all the above points was:

- To perform our data analysis, "translating" the information the videos gave us into the language of numbers (i.e., creating a CSV file with numerical values for a group of variables). 
- To anonymise the data by ensuring that no one could trace the children. 
- To share the resulting file in an open repository (e.g., Zenodo). 

However, there were some problems with this: 

- Too much information could not be captured "numerically". For example, qualitative information about the pedagogical value of certain educational actions of teachers cannot be summarised using numbers.
- That same qualitative information could not be shared using other semiotic systems (e.g., natural language), since that would have made it possible for others to identify the school where the research had been carried out (and potentially to identify the children). 
- We were not sharing the raw data, but the data resulting from the analysis. Thus: 

    - *We were closing the door on reproducibility*. Other researchers would not be able to replicate our analysis (i.e., they had no way of checking that we had not made a mistake in our analysis)
    - *We were closing the door on robustness*. Other researchers might have wanted to look at other variables, or perform another analysis on our same variables. By not sharing the videos, but the results of our analysis, this was impossible. 

As researchers, we knew just enough about research ethics (perhaps because these issues are not usually discussed during undergraduate/postgraduate studies?) We sought legal advice and began downloading material on regulatory frameworks. Some options we evaluated were: 
- Eliminating all contet where there was no information linked to the cognitive processes we were researching. 
- Pixeling the faces of the children and teachers, to avoid their recognition. 
- Replacing the human figures by diagrams, to prevent the children and teachers from being recognised. 

Again, these "solutions" were problematic. On the one hand, it could be that what we had not found relevant was relevant for another research team. In other words, it could be that our judgment was wrong. On the other hand, pixeling the faces or overlaying diagrams on the human figures would have solved the problem of data anonymity, but would also have left the researchers who might have benefited from our data with a problem: when investigating early cognitive development, information present in children's faces and bodies is crucial (e.g., to analyze the presence of emotions, or to evaluate correlations between motor development and cognitive development). To opt for either of the above options was to take away too much of the freedom of other researchers. 

The last thing left to explore was the option of modifying the informed consent to ask parents and/or guardians to explicitly consent to the online publication of their child's videos (i.e., *lawfulness* GDPR principle). However, thanks to the advice of the University's Research Ethics Committee, we learned that even if the children's parents agreed to have the videos uploaded to an open data repository, we would not be able to do so, because we would be violating the *integrity* GDPR principle: we could not guarantee that others would not perform unlawful processing of our data. 

Finally, we had to settle for sharing the results of our data analysis (but not the raw data) along with a set of metadata (e.g., authors, date created, date modified, type and model of camera used, filming technique, file type, file size). 

The *take-home messages* of this case study are: 
 
- As researchers, we need more knowledge about legal frameworks: they are very much related to our everyday scientific practices. 
- We researchers need to know and discuss more the ethical issues that arise while we are conducting research. 
- Even if you're all into Open Science and you honestly want to make data available for other people to foster reproducible practices, sometimes you simply can't.
- The nature of the data dramatically limits the degrees of freedom of the researchers. 
- Research is, ultimately, ***a dialogue between what you want, what you can, and what you should***: whenever you get to make a choice, be ***as open as you can***.

# Data licenses
## Introduction
The primary influence behind ***Data Licensing*** is to make ensure that the data you are including in your project must satisfy the needs of *"Reusable"* , one of the underlying principles and practices of [**FAIR** data management](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/rdm/fairprinciples.html), meanwhile protecting your data as well.

**Data Licenses** are a sort of memorandum that settles the acceptance between the two porties of which one of them is the author/ producer of the data and the next is the user of the same.

[Creative Commons (CC)](https://creativecommons.org) provides a bunch of licenses for various categories which assist you with shareability and reusablity of your data by handing-out free licenses that lets you to have certain permissions in-hand for diverse utilities in different scenarios. These scenarios can be referred from the flow chart that follows:

## License Creation
After getting aware of the scenarios and situations on where to use the licenses as discussed in the previous section's [**Flow Chart**](https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/scenarios.png), now it's time to create licenses for your own documentation and the data that it contains.
For the purpose of creating License, go through the following table <sup>1</sup> that clearly describes the icons to be used for  protecting your content:

:heavy_exclamation_mark: As a ***Licensor*** , you should [think twice carefully before applying any License to your documents](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-things-should-i-think-about-before-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license).

## All Rights Reserved

  Indicates the copyright symbol signifying <i>"All Rights Reserved"</i>. The documents containg the coprights symbolizes the user to seek permission from the owner before using it. The symbol constitutes of the owner and the work's first year of publication. A copyright symbol is generally not used for an unpublished work, however when it is used in an unpublished work , in that case the year it includes does not symbolizes the year of publication but the year the author distributes the work in some manner. </br>
  :warning:<b> All the copyrighted materials need permission from its owner.</b>
  </p>


## License Adaptation
As a ***"Licensee"*** ,before using the Licensed material you should be clear about the mentioned licenses uder the document.
Some common scenarios are as follows:
  #### __Material you wish to use is not permitted by the License:__
    1. Contact the Licensor for granting permission.
    2. If permission is not granted and still you use it, then you may be liable for copyright infringement.
    3. Do not violate the terms of the licenses.
 #### __Properly attributing the material offered under CC licenses:__
    1. You must retain copyright notice, a link to the license and a liense notice.
    2. You must clearly mention the mdified works and indication of the previous works. 
    3. You must be very careful not to imply any kind of endorsement,patronage or sponsorship in any medium.
#### __Can a CC licensed work be used in the format other than the published one:__
    1. Yes, these proposed licenses itself allows the licensee to use it meeting other conditions.
    2. True, even with the case of NoDerivative licenses. 
    3. If the material is published in pdf format you can still use it in .doc or the .txt.

You can still be more comfortable working with the licensed material having get to [know more](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#for-licensees).

## License Termination
The duration of CC licenses is until the underlying copyrights and similar rights expires. CC licenses are *"irrevocable"* implying that once you receive the material and the document under CC licenses you can always have the rights to use it, even if the licensor of the same has removed it, until the copyrights terminates. But you should still admire them by feeling of respect and stop using the same. 

*"No man is above the law and no man is below it: nor do we ask any man's permission when we ask him to obey it."* <br>

**Hence, we must follow all the rules and laws mentioned in the license agreements when we either wish to create it or want to adapt it !!!**



## Artificial Intelligence and Licenses
<p align="justify">
  The main motive to include this section uder <i>Data Licenses</i> is not to discuss about the most trending topic as so called <b><i>"Artificial Intelligence (AI)"</i></b> and its growing importance in our day-to-day life but, to develop awareness among the readers regarding its authorships and its related concerns with respect to <b>"Data Protection"</b>,and moreover it also dicusses how you can protect your data through various means as <i>Licenses,Acts,Regulations...and many more</i> whether you are a developer or the end user,  whenever anybody wants to make a move in this vast field of AI. </br>
  It's very important to know our readers that the base of this field is nevertheless the <b>"Data"</b>, and hence its a matter of concern to protect the data it includes via <i>Authorships, Settlements and Mutual Agreements</i>. 
  </p>
  
### AI Branches and Data Protection
<p align="justify">
  As AI has advanced too much, its increasing significance in the branches as depicted on the right side too has some major threats that needs to be taken careof:</p>
  
<img src="https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/B.png" width="51%" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20">
  <ul>
    <li><b>Clinical AI:</b></i><p align="justify"> We all know that data related to pateint's health is needed to be feed in the AI machines, so as to have AI algorithms, the better beneficial impact to the patients to whom they are applied and resulting knowledge should lead to measurable utility for the patient and outweigh associated risks or
potential harms. But, the conern is that <b><i>there must be some regulations regarding patient privacy and their confidential data for sharing</i></b> whenever AI is used for health care purposes. Collecting, using, and sharing patient health data raise concerns about the privacy of the affected individuals, whether those concerns are consequentialist (for instance, the possibility of future discrimination based on health status) or not (for example, dignitary concerns about others knowing embarassing and personal facts).
  </ul>
  </p>
  
<img src="https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/F.png" width="40%" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">
 <ul>
    <li><b>Financial Services:</b></li><p align="justify"> Although knowing the significance of AI in the financial services, as dicussed in the left side, it always been a fraud prone area when financial related data are being stolen by some wrong persons and misused by them. It's even more challenging to train AI algorithms to decide what is fraud and what-not, and which too needs a large volume of data. Firm or industry therefore thinks for nearly thousand times and checks for any loop hole before implementing AI for financial purposes.
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <img src="https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/M.png" width="40%" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20">
 <ul>
    <li><b>Marketing:</b></i><p align="justify"> Whenever you are placing orders on famous marketing platforms as that of Amazon and many more, you are giving many of your datas like bank account details, and many more related to bankings which should not be leaked anyhow, although they have played a very important role in quick and faster shopping and even you can do so when you are at home. AI is learning from your shopping, the interest in various commodities as per your previous orders and hence it's clear that AI is learning from your feeded data.
  </ul>
  </p>
  
### AI Ownership and Authorship
<img src="https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/P.png" width="40%" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">
<p align="justify">When the point comes to determine the best author among the three possible parties <b><i>Programmers; Owners</i></b> (large companies and financial investors in the AI sector); and <b><i>End Users</i></b>, it's always the best practise to consider the overall social benefit of the copyright attribution process. All the above three parties are resonable one for claiming the copyright of AI generated works. In which case the society would be benefitted the most i.e.,would society benefit most if copyright is assigned to the AI programmer, the investors responsible for funding the development of the AI, or the potentially millions of end users of AI programs. For examining this, each party's contribution should be evaluated and then to be finalized which party is suited best to posses authorship for AI works. Conclusively, the quintessential aim is to benefit the society atmost.
</p>  
  
### Solutions:
 * <p align="justify"> CC licenses solves much of the issues with copyrights on AI, but not actually fits with the concerns, as there are many issues which are not still addresed. Get more clarifications <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#artificial-intelligence-and-cc-licenses">here</a>.
  </p>

* <p align="justify"> <a href="https://www.montrealdatalicense.com/en">Montreal Data License (MDL)</a>  was initiated with more clarification and explication for use cases in the field of <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>AI</b>. The main aim of MDL is to bulid a platform towards a common framework for data licensing akin to the licensing of open source software.It provides a taxonomy for the licensing of data in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
  </p>
  
* <p align="justify"> There should be mutual agreements between all the three parties in the field of AI and Machine Leanring i.e., <b><i>Developer,Owner</i></b> and <b><i>End Users</i></b>. It should be ensured that everybody is enjoying the rights as required and nobody is over enjoying the rights.
  </p>

* <p align="justify"> Ai technology requires both the <i>Software</i> as well as <i>Data Licenses</i>, and hence there must be a balance between <b>"Reusability"</b> along with the <b>"Protection"</b> of the data included in the trending filed of AI and ML.
  </p>
  
  
* <p align="justify"> There are various acts associated with the health care AI and Clinical AI systems such as <b>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),</b> which contains certain rules and regulations to create privacy and security regarding certain health information and many more  rules like <b>Federal Trade Commision (FTC) Health Breach Notifiction Rule</b> which requires certain businesses to provide notifications to consumers after a breach of personal health record information, including information that may be collected to train, validate, date, or use health care AI systems.
  </p>

## Data Mining: Safe and Protective use
<p align="justify">
From our previous discussions it's seems that nearly everything depends fully or partially on <b><i>"Data"</i></b>, whether it's a machine generated woks as that the case of AI or human created contents and documentation.
  <b>"Data Mining"</b> which sometimes also termed as <b><i>"Text and Data Mining (TDM)"</b></i>, is yet another topic to be discussed as its increasing significance in ongoing research and education.
  </p>
 
### Text and Data Mining (TDM)
  <p align="justify">
  TDM is nothing but a process to collect and gather data and contents from various resources and then analyzing them for the purpose of searching, finding patterns, discovering relationships, semantic analysis and learning how content relates to ideas and needs in a way that they can benefit in the field of reaserach and education.
  From the above definition, it's clear that this process includes extraction and usage of datas and contents from other resources hence it's to be taken careof about any infrigement issues and how to use the contents safely of others' licensed material and that's the main intention behind this subsection to include here. The three basic steps necessary in the process of TDM includes:
  <ul>
  <li>Access the content</li>
  <li>Extracting the content</li>
  <li>Mining activities</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <img src="https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/data.png" width="100%" align="center">
  
  
  
  ## Issue: Clash Between TDM and Copyright Materials :warning:
  
<img src="https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/D.png" width="51%" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20"></img>
 <p align="justify">
By looking on the left side pannel, it's clear that you must take enough precautions while working with TDM. You must think hundred times of all the questions as potraited before aheading any step and working on others' materials. The main goal behind TDM should be the societal benefit atmost, considering the facts of Non-Profit Educational use and transformative (for instnce, if results not public available). It must be of the nature of factual based, maintaing the copyimg amount to smaller extent and not the central amount, proportionate for purpose. In any case it should not be used  for commercial means. It should be ensured hundred times that you must not exceed beyond the scope of license, otherwise it might be the case of infringement acts. It is not  always the case when the publisher will have the possibility of udertaking TDM activities to their contents but, yes might be in some cases it allows to do so.
  </p>
 
## Then, how to :thinking: use licensed data? :confused:
 <p align="justify">
  <ul>
    <li> Some of the publishers who are aware of the data mining process, i.e.,who are the actual right holders are explicitly addressing the TDM in their licenses. You must follow all the rules and regulation which have been put forward by the right holders as well as the laws binded by the license prior to proceedings for TDM on their content.</li>
   <li> <a href="https://royalsociety.org/journals/ethics-policies/data-sharing-mining/">The Royal Sciety Open Data policy</a> is the best platform for <b>Data Mining</b> and their <b><i>TDM activities</i></b>. It explicitly states that <b><i>“We support the stance that the right to read is the right to mine.”</i></b> </li>
    <li> In some cases the language or the wordings of the license is not clear. In such a case, it's very important to clarify those by contacting the Licensor or the actual right holder of their contents.</li>
    <li> You must examine whether the reproducibility works will going to affect the original one in any medium. You must take care of all the restrictions imposed on reproduction of any fragments or the sections by the licensor. </li>
    <li> Some right holders even apply technical protective measures to prevent the access of non-authorised users and restricts the systems and servers from accessing the large contents of their data. </li>
    
   </ul>  
 </p>
  
  
### Licensing your own mterial
  <p align="justify">
  CC licenses had extended their hands even to data, datasets and databases. It discusses how you can apply any <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-databases">License to your Data</a> by keeping in mind all the necessary facts which is required either when you are using <i>other's contents or licensing your own material</i>. Whenever you are applying license to your work which includes incorporating of the contents of others' you must need to check that you have done fair use of that content. Moreover, it's to be noted that CC licenses do not work for <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-offer-material-under-a-cc-license-that-has-my-trademark-on-it-without-also-licensing-or-affecting-rights-in-the-trademark">trademark and logo</a> as they limits the CC licenses for sharing in most cases. </br>

## Open Access in the field of Research
### Global Health Crisis: *"COVID-19"* - A case study
<p align="justify">
  Now, the time has come to enhance <i>Copyright Flexibilities on <b>"Data"</b></i> in order to enhance collaborative research in the evolution of vaccine and medicinal tool kits for the prevailing <i>Global Health Crisis: "COVID-19"</i>. The main influence to discuss this case study is that now we are well aware of the <i>Significance of Data</i> and how it plays its crucial role in every field and too forms the basis of all the toned public health issues and actions relted to them.
  Considering the necessities of the scientific research and data, it's substantial to have:
</p>

* <p align="justify"> All the publicly funded educational resources to be openly licensed in order to promulgate the reliable and empirical information to the public. </p>

* <p align="justify">All the publicly funded organiztions to adopt open access policies in order to facilitate the research with a dedication to public domain. </p>

* <p align="justify">All the health organizaations to support open access to encourage societal benefit atmost. </p>

## WHO and its Data Licenses and Policies
<p align="justify">
  <a href="https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/publishing-policies/copyright"> World Helath Organization (WHO) </a> is working hand-in-hand to spread awareness among the public during the widespread of the novel corona virus. Meanwhile it also helps researchers by supporting open access to its data and content. It inspires the researchers and various scientific and educational institutes to collect,use and share the data it publishes on <a href="www.who.init">WHO Website</a> to facilitate reproducibility. <b>"Data"</b> that it publishes are in the form of <b>"Datesets and Databases"</b> on which derived works have to meet certain <a href="https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/publishing-policies/data-policy/terms-and-conditions">terms and conditions</a> before get to work on it. It too permits the <a href="https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/publishing-policies/data-policy/text-for-inclusion-in-data-collection-forms">Data Provider</a> to share and publish information to WHO.
  </p>
  <p align="justify"> 
:warning: In order to reproduce, reprint and tranlate the WHO copyrighted material, WHO encourages you to <a href="https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/publishing-policies/permissions">fill the form</a> for seeking required permisssion.
  </p>
  
## CC and its Open COVID pledge
  <p align="justify">
  The data license provider, Creative Commons has now given importance to <b>"Open Access"</b>. It elucidates why the unhindered access to scientific and educational research is so crucial during the ongoing crisis. It elaborates in its <a href="https://opencovidpledge.org/">Open COVID pledge</a> , the need of eradicating the obstacles to sharing IP in the fight against the COVID-19. For the purpose of halting COVID-19 Pandemic, it has initiated three categories of <a href="https://opencovidpledge.org/licenses/licenses">licenses</a>:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://opencovidpledge.org/licenses/v1-0/">OCL-PC v1.0</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="https://opencovidpledge.org/licenses/v1-1-ocl-p/">OCL-P v1.1</a></li>
    <li> <a href="https://opencovidpledge.org/licenses/v1-1-ocl-pc/">OCL-PC v1.1</a></li>
    </ul>
    In addition to the above  licenses, it too supports <a href="https://opencovidpledge.org/licenses/intel-open-covid-license-v1-0/">Intel Open COVID License</a>. The main motive behind Open COVID Pledge is to call on organiztions around the world and maximize the copyrighted flexibilities in order to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We know how much important is collaborative works in the field of reproducibility, but the path or the medium is somewhat the open access to the data included in copyrighted material but sometimes its important to protect your data too as seen in our previous discussions.
  </p>
 
##### Hence, everyone should think :thinking: in a way "Data: From Preparation to Protection"

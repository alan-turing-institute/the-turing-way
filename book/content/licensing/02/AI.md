## Artificial Intelligence and Licenses
<p align="justify">
  The main motive to include this section uder <i>Data Licenses</i> is not to discuss about the most trending topic as so called <b><i>"Artificial Intelligence (AI)"</i></b> and its growing importance in our day-to-day life but, to develop awareness among the readers regarding its authorships and its related concerns with respect to <b>"Data Protection"</b>,and moreover it also dicusses how you can protect your data through various means as <i>Licenses,Acts,Regulations...and many more</i> whether you are a developer or the end user,  whenever anybody wants to make a move in this vast field of AI. </br>
  It's very important to know our readers that the base of this field is nevertheless the <b>"Data"</b>, and hence its a matter of concern to protect the data it includes via <i>Authorships, Settlements and Mutual Agreements</i>. 
  </p>
  
### AI Branches and Data Protection
<p align="justify">
  As AI has advanced too much, its increasing significance in the branches as depicted on the right side too has some major threats that needs to be taken careof:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Clinical AI:</b></i><p align="justify"> We all know that data related to pateint's health is needed to be feed in the AI machines, so as to have AI algorithms, the better beneficial impact to the patients to whom they are applied and resulting knowledge should lead to measurable utility for the patient and outweigh associated risks or
potential harms. But, the conern is that <b><i>there must be some regulations regarding patient privacy and their confidential data for sharing</i></b> whenever AI is used for health care purposes. Collecting, using, and sharing patient health data raise concerns about the privacy of the affected individuals, whether those concerns are consequentialist (e.g., the possibility of future discrimination based on health status) or not (e.g., dignitary concerns about others knowing embarassing and personal facts).
  </ul>

 <ul>
    <li><b>Financial Services:</b></li><p align="justify"> Although knowing the significance of AI in the financial services, as dicussed in the left side, it always been a fraud prone area when financial related data are being stolen by some wrong persons and misused by them. It's even more challenging to train AI algorithms to decide what is fraud and what-not, and which too needs a large volume of data. Firm or industry therefore thinks for nearly thousand times and checks for any loop hole before implementing AI for financial purposes.
  </ul>
  </p>

 <ul>
    <li><b>Marketing:</b></i><p align="justify"> Whenever you are placing orders on famous marketing platforms as that of Amazon and many more, you are giving many of your datas like bank account details, and many more related to bankings which should not be leaked anyhow, although they have played a very important role in quick and faster shopping and even you can do so when you are at home. AI is learning from your shopping, the interest in various commodities as per your previous orders and hence it's clear that AI is learning from your feeded data.
  </ul>
  </p>
  
### AI Ownership and Authorship
<img src="https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/P.png" width="40%" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">
<p align="justify">When the point comes to determine the best author among the three possible parties <b><i>Programmers; Owners</i></b> (large companies and financial investors in the AI sector); and <b><i>End Users</i></b>, it's always the best practise to consider the overall social benefit of the copyright attribution process. All the above three parties are resonable one for claiming the copyright of AI generated works. In which case the society would be benefitted the most i.e.,would society benefit most if copyright is assigned to the AI programmer, the investors responsible for funding the development of the AI, or the potentially millions of end users of AI programs. For examining this, each party's contribution should be evaluated and then to be finalized which party is suited best to posses authorship for AI works. Conclusively, the quintessential aim is to benefit the society atmost.

### Solutions:
 * <p align="justify"> CC licenses solves much of the issues with copyrights on AI, but not actually fits with the concerns, as there are many issues which are not still addresed. Get more clarifications <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#artificial-intelligence-and-cc-licenses">here</a>.

* <p align="justify"> <a href="https://www.montrealdatalicense.com/en">Montreal Data License (MDL)</a>  was initiated with more clarification and explication for use cases in the field of <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>AI</b>. The main aim of MDL is to bulid a platform towards a common framework for data licensing akin to the licensing of open source software.It provides a taxonomy for the licensing of data in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
  </p>
  
* <p align="justify"> There should be mutual agreements between all the three parties in the field of AI and Machine Leanring i.e., <b><i>Developer,Owner</i></b> and <b><i>End Users</i></b>. It should be ensured that everybody is enjoying the rights as required and nobody is over enjoying the rights.
  </p>

* <p align="justify"> Ai technology requires both the <i>Software</i> as well as <i>Data Licenses</i>, and hence there must be a balance between <b>"Reusability"</b> along with the <b>"Protection"</b> of the data included in the trending filed of AI and ML.
  </p>
  
  
* <p align="justify"> There are various acts associated with the health care AI and Clinical AI systems such as <b>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),</b> which contains certain rules and regulations to create privacy and security regarding certain health information and many more  rules like <b>Federal Trade Commision (FTC) Health Breach Notifiction Rule</b> which requires certain businesses to provide notifications to consumers after a breach of personal health record information, including information that may be collected to train, validate, date, or use health care AI systems.

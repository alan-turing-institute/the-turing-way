<p align="justify">
  Now, the time has come to enhance <i>Copyright Flexibilities on <b>"Data"</b></i> in order to enhance collaborative research in the evolution of vaccine and medicinal tool kits for the prevailing <i>Global Health Crisis: "COVID-19"</i>. The main influence to discuss this case study is that now we are well aware of the <i>Significance of Data</i> and how it plays its crucial role in every field and too forms the basis of all the toned public health issues and actions relted to them.
  Considering the necessities of the scientific research and data, it's substantial to have:
</p>

* <p align="justify"> All the publicly funded educational resources to be openly licensed in order to promulgate the reliable and empirical information to the public. </p>

* <p align="justify">All the publicly funded organiztions to adopt open access policies in order to facilitate the research with a dedication to public domain. </p>

* <p align="justify">All the health organizaations to support open access to encourage societal benefit atmost. </p>

  <a href="https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/publishing-policies/copyright"> World Helath Organization (WHO) </a> is working hand-in-hand to spread awareness among the public during the widespread of the novel corona virus. Meanwhile it also helps researchers by supporting open access to its data and content. It inspires the researchers and various scientific and educational institutes to collect,use and share the data it publishes on <a href="www.who.init">WHO Website</a> to facilitate reproducibility. <b>"Data"</b> that it publishes are in the form of <b>"Datesets and Databases"</b> on which derived works have to meet certain <a href="https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/publishing-policies/data-policy/terms-and-conditions">terms and conditions</a> before get to work on it. It too permits the <a href="https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/publishing-policies/data-policy/text-for-inclusion-in-data-collection-forms">Data Provider</a> to share and publish information to WHO.

  ## CC and its Open COVID pledge
  <p align="justify">
  The data license provider, Creative Commons has now given importance to <b>"Open Access"</b>. It elucidates why the unhindered access to scientific and educational research is so crucial during the ongoing crisis. It elaborates in its <a href="https://opencovidpledge.org/">Open COVID pledge</a> , the need of eradicating the obstacles to sharing IP in the fight against the COVID-19. For the purpose of halting COVID-19 Pandemic, it has initiated three categories of <a href="https://opencovidpledge.org/licenses/licenses">licenses</a>:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://opencovidpledge.org/licenses/v1-0/">OCL-PC v1.0</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="https://opencovidpledge.org/licenses/v1-1-ocl-p/">OCL-P v1.1</a></li>
    <li> <a href="https://opencovidpledge.org/licenses/v1-1-ocl-pc/">OCL-PC v1.1</a></li>
    </ul>
    In addition to the above  licenses, it too supports <a href="https://opencovidpledge.org/licenses/intel-open-covid-license-v1-0/">Intel Open COVID License</a>. The main motive behind Open COVID Pledge is to call on organiztions around the world and maximize the copyrighted flexibilities in order to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We know how much important is collaborative works in the field of reproducibility, but the path or the medium is somewhat the open access to the data included in copyrighted material but sometimes its important to protect your data too as seen in our previous discussions.

 ##### Hence, everyone should think :thinking: in a way "Data: From Preparation to Protection"

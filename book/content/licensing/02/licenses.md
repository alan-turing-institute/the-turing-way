# License Creation, Adaptation and Termination
## License Creation
After getting aware of the scenarios and situations on where to use the licenses as discussed in the previous section's [**Flow Chart**](https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/scenarios.png), now it's time to create licenses for your own documentation and the data that it contains.
For the purpose of creating License, go through the following table <sup>1</sup> that clearly describes the icons to be used for  protecting your content:


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Icon</th>
    <th>Right</th>
      <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
        <td><img src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.xlarge.png" alt="" height=45 width=50></img>
        <td>Creative Commons</td>
        <td>This indicates that the the document,images,course,music, or arts has a creative common license. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.xlarge.png" alt="" height=45 width=50></img>

    </tr>

        <td>No derivatives or adaptations of the work are permitted </td>
    </tr>

        <td>CC0</td>
        <td>“No Rights Reserved”-It gives then creators a way to waive all their copyright and related rights in their works to the fullest extent allowed by law.</td>
    </tr>

        <td> This work has been identified as being free of known restrictions under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights.

## License Adaptation
As a ***"Licensee"*** ,before using the Licensed material you should be clear about the mentioned licenses uder the document.
Some common scenarios are as follows:
  #### __Material you wish to use is not permitted by the License:__
    1. Contact the Licensor for granting permission.
    2. If permission is not granted and still you use it, then you may be liable for copyright infringement.
    3. Do not violate the terms of the licenses.
 #### __Properly attributing the material offered under CC licenses:__
    1. You must retain copyright notice, a link to the license and a liense notice.
    2. You must clearly mention the mdified works and indication of the previous works. 
    3. You must be very careful not to imply any kind of endorsement,patronage or sponsorship in any medium.
#### __Can a CC licensed work be used in the format other than the published one:__
    1. Yes, these proposed licenses itself allows the licensee to use it meeting other conditions.
    2. True, even with the case of NoDerivative licenses. 
    3. If the material is published in pdf format you can still use it in .doc or the .txt.

You can still be more comfortable working with the licensed material having get to [know more](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#for-licensees).

## License Termination
The duration of CC licenses is until the underlying copyrights and similar rights expires. CC licenses are *"irrevocable"* implying that once you receive the material and the document under CC licenses you can always have the rights to use it, even if the licensor of the same has removed it, until the copyrights terminates. But you should still admire them by feeling of respect and stop using the same. 

*"No man is above the law and no man is below it: nor do we ask any man's permission when we ask him to obey it."*<br>
***Hence, we must follow all the rules and laws mentioned in the license agreements when we either wish to create it or want to adapt it !!!***

# What are the benefits of doing reproducible science

> Papers whose underlying data is available get cited more often (Piwowar, Day & Fridsma, 2007; Piwowar & Vision, 2013).

There are several benefits of doing reproducible science:

1. **Improving usefulness of your work**

A reproducible science should contain a complete narrative of the research (also known as [Provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance)) and should include complete information of the data, tools, methods, codes, and documentations. By Creating a complete picture of your work, you can increase usefulness of your work for yourself and others in your field.

3. **Convinving reviewers**

Making code and data available to the reviewers means their review comments will be constructive as they are able to develop an in-depth understanding of your work and can even try changes to your analysis themselves and see the impact.

3. **Avoiding misinformation**

Reproducibility increases accuracy, trust, and confidence in your field broadly. By working reproducibly, you can trust your own research results and will not have to retract published results or keep publications back because you cannot reproduce your results. 

5. **Writing your paper efficiently**

Well documented analyses ensure that you have easy access to the latest results, your work can easily be written up, and collaborators can easily get on board as additional authors. Furthermore, you can be sure that you easily comply with the highest-level journal guidelines.

4. **Saves time for you in future to spend on doing things that are valuable for you**

- Easy to explain to your supervisors, funders, successers and your students what you did, what they can learn from it, how they can apply your work on different context and what they can do to expand your work.

Other benefits of working openly are covered in our [Open Reasearch](../open_research/open_research) chapter.

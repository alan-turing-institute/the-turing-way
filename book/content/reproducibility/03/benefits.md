# What are the benefits of doing reproducible science

> Papers whose underlying data is available get cited more often (Piwowar, Day & Fridsma, 2007; Piwowar & Vision, 2013).

There are several benefits of doing reproducible science:

**1. Track history of your data and code**

A reproducible science should contain a complete history and narrative of the research (also known as [Provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance)) and should include complete information of the data, tools, methods, codes, and documentations. By storing a complete track-record of your work, you can ensure sustainability, fair citation/acknowledgement, and usefulness of your work for yourself and others in your field.

**2. Facilitate collaboration and review process**

Making code and data available to your reviewers and collaborators will allow them develop an in-depth understanding of your work. This will encourage them to test your code, propose useful changes and share constructive feedback to advance your work.

**3. Avoid misinformation**

Reproducibility increases accuracy, trust, and confidence in your field broadly. By working reproducibly, you can trust your own research results and will not have to retract published results or keep publications back because you cannot reproduce your results. 

**4. Write your paper efficiently**

Well documented analyses ensure that you have easy access to the latest results, your work can easily be written up, and collaborators can easily get on board as future authors. Furthermore, you can be sure that you easily comply with the highest-level journal guidelines.

**5. Save time to work on other valuable ideas**

- By following guidelines for reproducibility, you can easily communicate your work with your supervisors, funders, successers and your students. They can track your progress, provvide useful feedback, and find application your work on different context to further expand your research.

Other benefits of working openly are covered in our [Open Reasearch](../open_research/open_research) chapter.

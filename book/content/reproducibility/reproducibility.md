## Summary

> The Turing Way defines reproducibility as *data and code being available to fully rerun the analysis*.

There are several definitions of reproducibility in use, and we discuss these in more detail in the [definitions](03/definitions) section of this chapter.

This chapter will lay out why reproducibility is important for science and scientists, provide an overview of the most common definitions, and define reproducibility in the context of this handbook.

## What can you learn in this section?

This chapter sets out the definition of reproducibility that the has been considered in the Turing Way project. It will be useful to avoid misunderstandings when reading the rest of the handbook.

In addition, this chapter includes motivations behind doing reproducible science by listing out the main benefits, values, and rewards as a researcher or a member of a scientific community. We have also collected a few examples and case studies that can help enhance your understanding of reproducibility in science before you set out to learn the different techniques and approaches.

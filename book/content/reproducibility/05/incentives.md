# * How to incentivize researchers/community members

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

**Problem**: There is a lack of motivation to do reproducible research (Ref: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02446.pdf)

**Solutions**:

	* Gamify your work:  "use of game design elements in nongame contexts": Badges, 
	* Rewards in terms of credits in the university, authorship, and acknowledgment in publications, prizes
	* Exchange (pay forward) reviews and identify issues with reproducibility in their work

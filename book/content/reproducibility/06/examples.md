# Examples and case studies from a scientific and volunteer based communities

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

1. What can we learn from the existing CoPs?
	
        * [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/): [Turing Way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)!
        * [ROpenSci](http://ropensci.github.io): [Reproducibility guide](https://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/introduction/), tutorial, [code review](https://ropensci.org/community/)
        * [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/): Technical training for enhancing reproducibility, template to create and adapt different components
        * [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/): Supports [projects](https://www.mozillapulse.org/tags/reproducibility), [Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/), [Study Group](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/4.3-repro.html)
        * [SSI](https://www.software.ac.uk): Facilitates [best practices in research](https://www.software.ac.uk/ssisearch?search_api_fulltext_1=reproducible&page=19)

2. Case Studies:
        * [Visible Human Project](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html): Insight Tool Kit: 207 contributors have created over 2400 unit tests that provide over 84% code line test coverage. The Insight Journal, an open publication journal associated with the toolkit, has seen over 360,000 publication downloads
        * [The Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) data sharing website](https://crcns.org/): The stored information includes metadata (experimental variables), processed data (e.g. spike times, behavioral events), intermediate level data (e.g. local field potential, spike waveforms, position data), and wide-band raw data for enabling reproducibility and cross-validation.
       * [Open Science MOOC](https://opensciencemooc.eu/): [Resources for Reproducible research](https://opensciencemooc.eu/resources/#three)

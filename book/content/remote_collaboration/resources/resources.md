## Managing and sharing resources across different stakeholders when collaborating remotely

Since we have gained an insight about setting [**Guidelines to ensure that remote collaborations are successful**](https://deploy-preview-962--the-turing-way.netlify.app/remote_collaboration/protocols/protocols.html), let us have a look into how to manage and share the available resources in a remote collaboration. This step results in an efficient distribution of the resources and the maximum utilisation of the remotely collaborating members.

### Stakeholders
---
- **Stakeholders** refer to individuals or group of individuals who might affect or be affected by the decisions, actions or policies of an organization.  The distribution of the resources takes into account the different stakeholders, and their stakes into account. The best practice is to distribute the resources in proportionate to the stakes, various stakeholders hold.

- The stakeholders can be categorized into mainly:
	1. **Internal Stakeholders** which includes the individuals who 	 have collaborated for the project, including the project manager and also the leaders of smaller teams.
	2. **External Stakeholders** which includes the customers, the testers, partners, vendors.

### Management and Sharing of Resources
---
Few things to keep in mind:
- **Obtain the necessary resources as required**
		 Collect the resources on a pre-determined budget. Never attempt to put on frantic effort to collect resources which could ultimately prove to be redundant. To ensure this, the leaders should have small meetings with their group members, and amongst themselves before finally submitting a detailed report of required resources to the manager.
- **Segmentation of resource**
	As per the detailed report, segment the resources to various teams.    
	1. The data about how the existing product is accepted in the market and how similar products are accepted can lead the data analyst team to find out the features which are most desired by the users for the particular product. The data analyst team should also be provided with the proper environment setup, which would be helpful in the process of prediction of features. 
	2. The design team should be provided with the customers' opinion regarding the most attractive designs and also the available state-of-the-art online facilities to aid in their designing process.
- **Sharing as per the segmentation** 
	Route the resources as per the segmentation achieved. This would ensure the optimized utilisation of the teams. This is because, the teams have been formed with a certain goal. The resources that help to reach that goal would help the team to perform the best.
- **Managing the resources** 
	The collection, segmentation and sharing of resources should be followed by the management of the resources. This includes verification of the segmentation procedure and also checking that the proper amount of resources is allocated to the different teams as per their need.

The above set of steps could be repeated in a cycle to ensure that each team finally receives the resources it needs to achieve the goal. The cycle should stop when the requirements of each team is met.

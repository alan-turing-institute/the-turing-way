## Resource management for remote collaboration

In this part of the remote collaboration chapter, we will look into managing and sharing the available resources with different stakeholders.
We will further discuss bow suitable tools can be selected and offered for communication, project management, skill enhancement and collaboration to ensure their accessibility and maximum utilisation by collaborating members.

### Identifying your stakeholders
---
- **Stakeholders** refer to individuals or group of individuals who might affect or be affected by the decisions, actions or policies of a project or an organization.  
In a data research project, they are typically the members of a project planning team, managers, funders, developers, volunteer contributors and users who can offer their input to impact the overall outcome of the project.
The choice of resources that can be offered to different stakeholders will depend on first identifying who they are and what processes or tasks they are involved in. 
- The stakeholders can be categorized mainly into:
	1. **Internal Stakeholders** which includes the individuals who have collaborated for the project, including the project manager and also the leaders of smaller teams.
	2. **External Stakeholders** which includes the customers, the testers, partners, vendors.

### Management and Sharing of Resources
---
We all know that the teams are the most important part of an organisation. 
Building a great team is a great leap ahead in work. 
Thus it is essential to select a great team. 
Some important factors to consider while selecting a remote team:

- Hire dedicated people, who really want to be a part of remote team
- Select people who can be trustworthy in long run
- Try to hire people, who can collaborate in a remote environment.

One important aspect of management and sharing of resources in remote collaboration is regular interaction between the collaboraters.
Only forming a team is not enough. 
It is essential to have platform(s), where managers can check the team's progress on how effectively the resources provided are being used. 
A few suggestions can be having a Slack workspace, having online Zoom or GoToWebinar meetings.

Such meetings have to pre-planned so that the aim of the meeting is achieved, and it does not render to be a waste of valuable time and resources. 
Some tips for conducting online meetings could be:
1. Select a **suitable time-zone**, since remote collaborations involve people from different time zones across the world.
2. Create a list of organizers, facilitators, speakers or any other important roles as per the need. **Assign the roles** to members and inform them in prior.
3. **Discuss the agenda** of the meeting, and prepare the presentation(s), question and answers well in time. This would help to increase the chances of meeting being a great success.
4. Select a **suitable online platform** for the meetings. Out of the huge number of such platforms abvailable, study the pros and cons of each, decide which would suit the type of meeting you have to organise and then go for it.
5. During the meeting, **maintain the etiquettes and protocols** to conduct the meeting in a healthy way. 
6. **Give breaks** in between meetings and keep the meeting engaging and lively. Allow short discussions, polls and question answers on recent developments.
7. The meeting should be concluded well, providing meaningful direction to each collaborator on their next work before they meet again. A **minutes of meeting** could be shared with all, to provide an overview of the entire meeting.

Such meetings play an essential role in management of the resources in a remote collaboration.

### Checklist
---
Few things to keep in mind while sharing and managing resources across different stakeholders in a remote collaboration:
- **Obtain the necessary resources as required**
1. Collect the resources on a pre-determined budget. 
Never attempt to put on frantic effort to collect resources which could ultimately prove to be redundant. 
To ensure this, the leaders should have small meetings with their group members, and amongst themselves before finally submitting a detailed report of required resources to the manager.
2. The report may include the procedure of collection of resources, the role of external stakeholders in the process and the medium through which the resources could be collected (creation of polls, workshops for the external stakeholders).
								
- **Segmentation of resource**
	As per the detailed report, segment the resources to various teams.    
	1. The data about how the existing product is accepted in the market and how similar products are accepted can lead the data analyst team to find out the features which are most desired by the users for the particular product. 
 The data analyst team should also be provided with the proper environment setup, which would be helpful in the process of prediction of features. 
	2. The design team should be provided with the customers' opinion regarding the most attractive designs and also the available state-of-the-art online facilities to aid in their designing process.
- **Sharing as per the segmentation** 
	Route the resources as per the segmentation achieved. 
  This would ensure the optimized utilisation of the teams. 
  This is because, the teams have been formed with a certain goal. 
  The resources that help to reach that goal would help the team to perform the best.
- **Managing the resources** 
	The collection, segmentation and sharing of resources should be followed by the management of the resources. 
  This includes verification of the segmentation procedure and also checking that the proper amount of resources is allocated to the different teams as per their need. 
  A great way to conduct this step, is to have online meetings. 
  This is beacuse in a remote collaboration it is quite difficult to have meetings in a hall,  where all the members could be present.

The above set of steps could be repeated in a cycle to ensure that each team finally receives the resources it needs to achieve the goal. 
The cycle should stop when the requirements of each team is met.

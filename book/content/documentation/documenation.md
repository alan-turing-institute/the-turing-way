# Documentation

## About
Both the project and the source code should be documented in order for others to understand what the project is about, how they can use it and how they can contribute to it.

### Markdown
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. GitHub and other project and code hosting services automatically render markdown files for humans to read.

You can learn [CommonMark syntax](https://commonmark.org/help/) use online editors to practice, for example [commonmark.js dingus](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/) or [markdown-it demo](https://markdown-it.github.io).

## Project Documentation
Describe your project for others to understand what it is about, what is the audience, how others can contribute to it. The [Mozilla Open Leadership Training Series](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/) [*Opening Your Project Chapter*](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/) is a good starting point to learn about how to effectively communicate information about your project. It is also common for projects to have [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) documentation.

### README
The [README](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) file (whose name by convention is written in all-caps, and represents a request to one and all— “read me!”) is one of the first things that potential contributors will encounter when learning about your project. Note that it is possible for a README file to be named, for example `README.txt`, `README.md` of `README.rst`, depending on its format.  It is also important to mention that, in case more than one README file is needed, it should be placed in a docs sub-folder, and referenced from the main one, in order to avoid confusion.

Read more about documentation in the collaborating chapter.

### CONTRIBUTING (link to collaboration chapter)
[Contributor guidelines](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/), by convention are described in the file called CONTRIBUTING. They are the nuts and bolts instructions on how to contribute to your project. Learn more on how to write effective guidelines in [Getting Contributors](collaborating_github/3/getting_contributors) section.

### ROADMAP
[Example of ROADMAP file](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/roadmap.html#roadmap) from Read The Docs project.

### CHANGELOG
A changelog is a list of relevant major and minor changes between software releases, as well as bug fixes. Comments from commits between releases can help composing the change-log, but they are not a replacement.

See [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for more information.

### Code of Conduct (link to collaboration chapter)

### Software Citation (expand section in recognition chapter)

## Code Documentation
There are many resources highlighting the importance of good code documentation. Here is [a blog post](https://medium.com/@andrewgoldis/how-to-document-source-code-responsibly-2b2f303aa525) and an [example of Rosseta Commons community](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/development_documentation/Coding-Conventions).

### code comments

### API documentation
For a library the API documentation is the same as the code documentation such as description of classes/functions/constants etc.

For a web service there are standards that like [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) or [Graphql](https://graphql.org/).

### usage documentation
For a command line interface you could make a [man page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) with examples.

### development setup

### description of issue labels

### code style (link to review)

### how to file a bug report

### Software version
For numbering software versions, it is common to use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

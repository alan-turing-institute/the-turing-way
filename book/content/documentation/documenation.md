# Documentation

## About
Both the project and the source code should be documentated in order for others to understand what the project is about, how they can use it and how they can contribute to it.

### Markdown
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. GitHub and other project and code hosting services automatically render markdown files for humans to read.

You can learn [CommonMark syntax](https://commonmark.org/help/) use online editors to practice, for example [commonmark.js dingus](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/) or [markdown-it demo](https://markdown-it.github.io).

## Project Documentation
Describe your project for others to understand what it is about, what is the audience, how others can contribute to it. The [Mozilla Open Leadership Training Series](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/) [Opening Your Project Chapter](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/) is a good starting point to learn about how to efectively communicate information abou your project.

### README
The [README](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) file (whose name by convention is written in all-caps, and represents a request to one and all— “read me!”) is one of the first things that potential contributors will encounter when learning about your project. Read more about documenation in the collaborating chapter.

### CONTRIBUTING (link to collaboration chapter)
[Contributor guidelines](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/), by convension are described in the file called CONTRIBUTING. They are the nuts and bolts instructions on how to contribute to your project. Learn more on how to write effective guidelines in Getting Contributors section.

For a command line interface you could make a [man page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) with examples.

### development setup

### description of issue labels

### code style (link to review)

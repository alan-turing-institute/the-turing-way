# Error management

## 1. Why should you care about error management?

~~~

## 2. Some simple examples on error management (e.g. if/else; if someone gets only this far they already have some simple ideas on how to get started on making their assumptions explicit!)

~~~

## 3. Making silent errors visible, how to get out of the worst state; how to get your code to warn you if you are in a silent failure state.

~~~

## 4. Dealing with unintelligible errors, both in your code (automating error management) and other peoples' (troubleshooting).

~~~

### 5. Writing informative error messages in your own code, what does a good error look like?

# Checklist

## For Researchers

* [ ] Consider a range of possible presentation delivery methods for disseminating your results.
* [ ] Review examples of research in your field in the press that are accurate and examples that are not.
* [ ] What is your main result? Why should your audience care about this result?
* [ ] Focus your outreach efforts on conveying this main result. Specifics and details can come later if the audience is interested.
* [ ] Think about how your work would appear in an article on the front page of the news, not in a peer-reviewed journal article.
* [ ] If you are making visual aids, take away any detail that does not serve the main result.
* [ ] Identify and start to plan for outreach activities when you start your project.
* [ ] Identify resources and specific groups that you plan to target.
* [ ] Speak regularly with the Communications Team at your institution. They can help you craft your outreach efforts.
* [ ] Implement practice methods to help you improve your performance.
* [ ] Make yourself accessible and rehearse a simple 'elevator pitch' description of your work.
* [ ] Demonstrate thoughtful, scientifically literate engagement to others around you.
* [ ] Identify potential communication collaborators, both internally and externally.
* [ ] Actively maintain and develop outreach relationships and activities even when directly related to your project.

## For Supervisors

* [ ] Budget time and other resources needed for outreach into grant proposals.
* [ ] Allow for researchers to attend training courses on outreach activities.

## For group leaders

* [ ] Have a repository with material the group has used for previous outreach to give examples.

# Summary

The goal of this chapter is provide a manifesto that functions as a set of general guidelines on best practices for doing data science outreach.

<!-- OG: I feel this should have more examples of outreach? -->
<!-- TP: Agreed with OG comment. -->
Outreach is an umbrella term for a broad range of activities which engage researchers with audiences external to the research team, including other scientists, the general public, journalists and policy makers. Outreach can provide major benefits to both researchers and society, from enhancing the visibility of your work to developing public understanding of science. However, as with all research activities, outreach requires careful planning and resourcing, while researchers share a collective responsibility to combat the spread of misinformation and provide the public with an accurate representation of science. While outreach activities are diverse in scope, we believe that all high quality outreach is underpinned by a set of shared underlying principles.

<!-- ED: Examples go here, perhaps? Feel free to move them and put them into a uniform format -->

To illustrate the diverse ways that research can be shared in the broader context of society, here are several examples of outreach work done by the team that wrote this chapter:
<!-- TP: Arrange these blurbs in alphabetical order based on surname. -->

* Eric Daub, a data scientist and geophysics researcher, has appeared on several television programs and podcasts to discuss his research on earthquake occurrence in the Central United States. One challenge for presenting earthquake research is the tendency to overhype results on the topic of earthquake prediction. Eric used these media appearances to highlight the difficulties inherent in predicting earthquakes, and explain why no reliable method exists to predict earthquakes accurately enough for societal actions to take place. From that discussion about overhyped results, he transitioned to explaining how his research showed that the chances of an earthquake had not changed due to recent changes in activity, as the fluctuations were *exactly* in line with what would be expected for a simple baseline level of risk. This outreach activity helped improve the understanding of the target audience on a complex, technical subject and debunk some of the commonly held assumptions about earthquake prediction and risk management.

* While studying Astrophyics, Benjamin Mummery was the first speaker at, and later organizer of, Liverpool PubHD ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pubhdliverpool/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pubhd_liverpool?lang=en-gb)) - a monthly cross-discipline event that challenged PhD students to "explain their research in 10 minutes, while enjoying a pint." During this time he also developed and delivered multiple more official outreach events including presenting to both the public and airforce commanders at [RAF Cosford Airshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KImlYiCO7Vs), and frequent activities for schools. Now a Research Software Engineer at the Hartree Centre, he has continued his engagement with outreach, most recently in collaboration with Tim Powell designing a LEGO version of the Centre's iconic supercomputer [Scafell Pike](https://twitter.com/HartreeCentre/status/1189145621564968963). He can frequently be found banging on about [fictional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrqfT4aotfE) [time travel](https://inews.co.uk/culture/film/donnie-darko-reviewed-astrophysicist-531742).

* Tim Powell is an Astrophysicist turned Research Software Engineer, who has always had a passion for sharing science. From attending public lectures and getting involved as an attendee at outreach events based around Cambridge as a teenager to building a miniature supercomputer, Tim has a long history of outreach activities. Whilst at university Tim became a STEM Ambassador with the Physics Society, where he used the tools provided to introduce groups of children to scientific concepts. Tim also participated in 4 [British Science Weeks](https://www.britishscienceweek.org/) showcasing many different aspects of Physics and Remote Sensing. When Tim joined STFC's Hartree Centre he built a miniature supercomputer, called [HPiC](https://blog.hartree.ac.uk/wordpress/?p=361). HPiC is the Hartree Centreâ€™s Raspberry Pi Cluster. It was created to demonstrate supercomputing techniques and show some of the expertise of the Hartree Centre. HPiC has been showcased at numerous [technical conferences](https://twitter.com/MrTimPowell/status/1062098668403245058) and [public outreach events](https://twitter.com/HartreeCentre/status/1055029464592273408) not just across the UK but also internationally. As well as presenting technical posters and talks at various conferences Tim also enjoys taking his experience of outreach and presenting what he has learnt and how that is applicable to teaching. Tim presented at the ISC 2019 HPC Education and Training for Emerging Technologies Workshop and was on [SIGHPC](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/) Best Practices for HPC Training and Education Panel at Supercomputing 2019. One of Tim's proudest projects  was collaborating with Benjamin Mummery on a LEGO version of the Hartree Centre's iconic supercomputer [Scafell Pike](https://twitter.com/HartreeCentre/status/1189145621564968963)!

* Camila Rangel Smith, a data scientist and former particle physicist originary from Venezuela has focused her outreach activities in reaching students based in universities in Latinoamerica. She is a co-founded of the [CEVALE2-VE project](http://www.cevale2ve.org/en/home/), a virtual learning community of particle physics that aims to tackle the serious issue of brain-drain in some of these developing countries, by bringing back the knowledge in a digital/online platform.

One of the main goals of the manifesto is to express the importance of outreach in the research cycle, both in the academia and industry, and this way change the general consensus of outreach from volunteering to essential.

These are the principles of the manifesto:

1. We should present results accurately and responsibly to clearly convey research findings and avoid common misconceptions.
2. We should communicate and coordinate effectively with different audiences in an accessible and diverse way: journalists, general public, industry, other data scientists.
3. We should approach projects with the expectation that outreach is an integral part, providing the administrative resources necessary to facilitate outreach.
4. We should develop an organic relationship with other people involved in communications and information brokering (e.g. comms groups, journalists) by providing training, collaborating and coordinating.
5. We should be advocates for general scientific literacy in our organisations and the public.

Each principle will be developed in the following sections.

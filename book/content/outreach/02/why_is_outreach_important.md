# Why is outreach important?

<!---BM: is "duty" too didactic here?--->
In this chapter we want to convince you, the researcher, that it is your duty to do outreach. The reasons for doing outreach are various, from career enhancement, skills development to the pure dissemination of knowledge. 

We have summarised the main points that should motivate you to complement your research cycle with outreach activities:
    
* Help the public gain some understanding of scientific concepts and inspire next generations to pursue a career in research. 
* Outreach activities can help convince the public that your research matters and why governments (and hence the tax payer) should support it [[1]](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/scientists-do-outreach-or-your-science-dies/).
* The effort of explaining your research to a non-specialist audience forces you to see the big picture and decide what is really important. This exercise of abstraction can positively impact the view of your own work as a researcher. Furthermore, outreach is an excellent opportunity to practice and improve your communication skills (this skill is particularly valuable for early career researchers, as advancing your career depends on convincing others that you are able to deliver impactful research).
* Participating in outreach activities has been shown to raise the profile of researchers and to improved career opportunities [[2]](https://www.ukri.org/files/legacy/scisoc/rcukbenefitsofpe-pdf/).
* There is a crisis of public trust in science, with very vocal anti-science movements in debates around high profile issues such as vaccines [[3]]( https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-33774181), climate change [[4]](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/PT.3.1431), and other fields involving expert knowledge[[5]](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2019/01/28/the-deep-roots-of-the-trust-crisis/). It is our duty as researchers to fight misinformation by making our research approachable and understandable to the public.

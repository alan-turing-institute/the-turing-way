# Presenting Results

> We should present results accurately and responsibly to clearly convey research findings and avoid common misconceptions.

When you are undertaking outreach to any audience it is essential to clearly demonstrate the scientific research that has been performed. Without such scientific research there is nothing with which to engage an audience, and thus you can lose emphasis on whatever message you are trying to present. However, the presentation of results is the first, and arguably most important, aspect of outreach that needs to be overcome. You can publish on the most viewed website, or highest renowned print media, but if you don't present your message accurately you might as well have not bothered!

Over-hyped reporting of results is one of the most damaging challenges of outreach. Genuine breakthroughs are followed by enthusiastic exploration; soon the speculative is conflated with the possible and decades worth of research is expected in a matter of days. Eventually the public become disillusioned and funding is withdrawn. This is the effect of over-hyped results.

Over-hype or misreporting is often due to a miscommunication or an attempt to feel relevant. It may be tempting, especially for early career researchers, to make your research sound more exciting for non-domain specialists or the general public. There may be short-term benefits, such as awarded funding and a larger visibility. But the constant under-delivery on the over-promised conclusions creates a culture of mistrust and encourages fundamental science to be questioned. Not only will the true research be under-represented but the reported results may be untrue. As researchers, truth is one of the largest factors driving our passion for exploration and should be held in the highest regard.

WIRED have a fantastic article on [The Life-Threatening Consequences of Overhyping AI](https://www.wired.com/story/the-life-threatening-consequences-of-overhyping-ai/) [1]. They breakdown how a popular news outlet was very selective over what they reported on from a Nature article, only giving evidence for times when the AI beat beat human doctors. It is this kind of misreporting which has the potential to be dangerous and negatively affect peoples lives.

Unfortunately, we live in a culture where it is hard to always believe the latest headlines and so called "fake news" is rife. With a little more care and attention given over to presenting research in a robust way, a cultural shift can start to take place. As you will read throughout this manifesto, it is our responsibility as researchers to be reputable and produce reputable work.

There are two stages to consider when collating a research project for outreach:

* **Preventative Outreach** is about presenting so that you, and your research, can't be over-hyped or taken out of context to fuel someone else's agenda. In other words, how to stop overhype and misconceptions. One of the best ways to do preventative outreach is to directly address what your research *does* and *doesn't* say. Dispel any potential misinterpretations before they happen.
* **Symptomatic Outreach** is the other side of the equation. It is about addressing existing public misconceptions and overhype within your research. Shying away from or ignoring current false reporting or misunderstandings of your research field is never going to fix the damage already done. One great example of symptomatic outreach is the book "Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs" by Lisa Randall from Harvard University. Randall published a paper on "[Dark Matter as a Trigger for Periodic Comet Impacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0576)" [2], which was picked up by the media. However, the media only covered a small humorous aside from her research, that dark matter could have played a role in killing the dinosaurs. Randall took this misconception and used the flashy titles of the news articles as a jumping off point for a much broader discussion on the nature of the Universe, dark matter, the Milky Way galaxy, comets, astroids, and impacts.

This section gives practical tips and guidelines on how to present results accurately and responsibly in order to clearly convey research findings and avoid common misconceptions or be taken out of context and overhyped.

The section is broken down into two themes:

* Presentation - How the research should be exhibited.
* Precision - How the research is credible.

## Presentation

There are a large variety of ways to present results for outreach, from powerpoint presentations, to posters, to interactive demos. Each of these have different appropriate audiences and some of them are not always suitable. It is up to you as the presenter to consider the different approaches of presenting and your audience. The practical tips we've outlined here are for you to consider, and to assist you in deciding how to best approach your outreach.

### Practical Tips

<!-- Need to check the grammar rules re: take away, take-away, takeaway-->
* Know your main take away

  When starting to prepare some research or a project for outreach, start by thinking about your main take away. This should be 1 or 2 sentences that you want your audience to leave knowing and understanding. This is your starting point.

* Bookend your presentation
  
  Start and finish with the same conclusion, this re-enforces your main point and allows for early leavers, late arrivals, and distracted people to understand your presentation. Always remember:
  * Tell them what you are going to tell them.
  * Tell them.
  * Tell them what you told them.

* Tell a story

  Nobody wants to be bored and everything has a story. To get the most impact your presentation needs to be memorable to be able to retold again and again without being distorted. Building the research into a story helps this to happen. Some might think that research is a serious business and results should be treated with gravitas that a story cannot deliver. However, all that we do is a story, it is a story of a team of researchers, who are driven by a specific motivation, who apply a series of intricate methods or conduct a set of experiments, who make observations and interpretations all in the search of new knowledge. This is the story you want to tell. This gives weight to the knowledge you are imparting, it gives reason for the knowledge to exist, and it gives authenticity that proper due process was taken to deliver the research.

* Know your audience

  * Avoid using domain specific jargon and acronyms. These alienate your audience and create an atmosphere of superiority around the presenter. Contrary to this, a room full of experts aren't going to be interested in being taught the basics.
  * You should also consider the age of your audience and what is important in their life. Children aren't going to be enthralled by how a machine learning implementation could save money on household bills, but will be captivated by literally anything involving dinosaurs.

* Cater to different types of learners

  There are a number of different models describing how people learn best. The [VARK model](http://vark-learn.com/) [3] is a popular and widely used model. The VARK model identifies 4 different types of learners, which we have listed below with tips on engaging them with your presentation.

  * Visual Learners

    These type of learners perfer to see infomration and visualise the relationships between ideas. They respond best to infographics and charts, and will take in a lot more information from a video or slides than from what you are saying.
  
  * Auditory Learners

    Auditory learners absorb information from hearing about it rather than reading or seeing it. A really good way to help auditory learners cement what you have told them is to get them to recite it out loud, this can be done in form of a Q&A session. For example, if you are teaching a group a new concept you can ask them "Can you tell me in your own words what I have just taught you?".

  * Reading / Writing Learners

    For reading and writing learners, interacting with text is the most powerful way to digest information, whether this be reading from a text book or writing notes during a seminar / lecture. Giving these type of learners annotated handouts at the start of a talk can help them follow your presentation.

  * Kinesthetic Learners

    A hands-on approach will help kinesthetic learners understand the research you are presenting. This may not always be practical depending on logistics and location, but getting kinesthetic learners moving and interacting with a demo will enhance their learning experience of your presentation. If there's anything you can have passed around the audience to illustrate a point, this is an excellent opportunity to cater to these learners.

* Encourage audience interaction
  
  It is often very hard to encompass all the work and research you are trying to present, and audience members may be left with questions at the end of your presentation. It is also common for presentations to be followed by a Q&A session. Traditionally, this would mean a hands up or come to the front of the auditorium situation. However, this classical approach does not encourage inclusivity and diversity.
  
  A solution to this is to use online Q&A toolkits such as [sli.do](https://www.sli.do), where audience members can ask questions, vote in polls, and be part of the discussion without having to race to a microphone or be left to random chance of being picked with their hand up. This type of tool creates a more inclusive environment, people are less afraid of asking questions, and it generates a more diverse and relevant pool of questions. It also encourages discussion to be continued past your presenting time slot as you can continue to answer questions through a web interface.

* Consider multiple delivery methods

  Listed here is a non-exhaustive selection of delivery methods with some thoughts on each. The delivery method will change drastically depending on your audience, the message you wish to deliver, and the available media formats.

  * White paper
    * Very formal, lots of place for detail, primarily researcher to researcher.
    * More of an interest in technical results and methodology.
  * Traditional media articles (magazines and newspapers)
    * Much more public consumption. Large, wide audience where less context can be assumed.
    * Interest is going to be in impact rather instead of results.
  * Social media
    * Needs to be very short but can have the widest reach. Contains the least amount of content and context. Generally only good for headlines. Include links to more detail.
    * This can be a good way to have communication with people directly. Chance to develop a discussion but also can encounter trolls.
  * Personal blogs
    * Generally not a wide reach but can have a good reception to your local community.
    * Good place for items that don't naturally fit in anywhere else (i.e. personal projects).
  * Institutional blogs
    * Potential for a wide reach and lead to talks or funding opportunities. The audience will more likely have domain specific knowledge.

* Use a wide range of formats

  Even the most interesting person can't make a "death by powerpoint" presentation exciting. Avoid becoming monotonous by varying how you are presenting. Consider using:

  * Images
    * Jokes and memes are a good way to engage the audience as well as giving information
    * Remember a picture can portray a lot more than words can
  * Graphs
    * Using graphs to portray information can be very powerful, but you must be careful. Changing a graph or combining graphs which are unrelated for ease of reading can easily be misunderstood.
  * Animations
    * Animations are a great way to explain complicated concepts that can't be replicated at a human scale, e.g. molecular science or cosmology.
  * Video
    * Has an expert in the field recently discussed the concept you are talking about, or discussed an application you are presenting?s Consider using short video clips to give supporting evidence.
    * Be cautious of the distribution and licensing of any videos you do use.
  * Audio
    * Audio can give weight to an otherwise silent video or animation. Use it to guide the audience's emotion.
      * For example: imagine seeing a video of a supernova explosion. In reality an observer would not hear any noise as sound does not travel in space, but how much more effective will the video be at portraying the size and power of a supernova explosion with a well designed audio track.

* Practice makes perfect

  Standing up and being able to do a talk or present a demonstration without any practice is a rare skill and one that is developed over time. For the majority of people practice is an essential ingredient to delivering a professional presentation and will give you more confidence. Listed here are a few techniques to help you practice.

  * Record yourself

    By hearing and seeing yourself you can be in your own audience, you can notice when you speak too fast or use the wrong inflection. Don't worry initially about timing or messing up, use your recordings to make notes on your presentation and try and implement them a second time. As with most practice methods, this is an iterative process.

  * Present to your peers

    Since it is very different practicing on your own to presenting to an audience, gather a group of your peers or family and friends and present to them. This allows you to get a natural human reaction to your presentation and will help in making you more confident in front of a crowd. You'll find that your worst mistakes will surface on your first run throughs and you will have time to fix them.

  * Time yourself

    Once you have secured the content that you want to get across it is important to deliver it in the time frame you have. Timing your presentation should be one of your last practice steps. Don't be afraid of removing content if you are going over, a well thoughtout talk is much more likely to resonate with your audience more than a rushed talk because you are trying to get more information crammed in.

## Precision

Precision in presenting research is paramount.

As researchers you are exploring new concepts, developing knowledge, and pushing the edges of understanding. Being precise in your presentation is essential to not only deliver the results of your research but to stop rumor and misinformation being spread as a result of your conclusions.

One way to stop your presentation of results being falsely reported on or misunderstood is to recognize how it could be interpreted. Understanding this will give you the awareness you need to present the results of your research in a robust manner. Discussed below is some techniques for identifying how you could be misrepresented.

* Common pitfalls

  You are the expert in your results and you have the best understanding of the context. You may already have laughed at similar work which has been wrongly reported. Study these misrepresented reports. Discover how the original work was taken out of context or presented unclearly; in other words identify the common pitfalls. You can then avoid falling into the same problem in how you present your results.

* Errors and uncertainties

  In all areas of research their are errors and uncertainties. It is the nature of research and is a core part of implementing a robust methodology. As such they should always be reported on and discussed. Don't shy away from them, embrace them and explain them.

  Not understanding how errors affect a result is a common problem in scientific reporting. Presenting what your error boundaries are and what assumptions were made in the study is important, but equally important is explaining what the impact of the errors is on the result of the study and why those assumptions were made. Don't be afraid to categorically say what your results do not say.

* Turning a negative into a positive

  If something in which you have been involved has fallen to misinterpretation or false reporting don't just chalk it up to bad luck or experience. You can turn a negative into a positive!

  Don't be afraid to call out people for misrepresenting you or your work. Take it as an opportunity to gain more exposure and correct the reporter. Not only will this grow your credibility, it will deliver the truth that your research uncovered.

## Always remember

You can’t stop fools, cranks, and malicious people! Your job is to make your message as understandable as theirs. You can only talk to people who will listen.

## Acceptance testing

Acceptance tests are one of the last tests types that are performed on software prior to delivery. 
Acceptance testing is used to determine whether a piece of software satisfies all of the requirements from the business or user's perspective. 
Does this piece of software do what it needs to do? 
These tests are sometimes built against the original specification.

Because research software is typically written by the researcher that will use it (or at least with significant input from them) acceptance tests may not be necessary.

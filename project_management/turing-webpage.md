# 'The Turing Way' - A handbook for reproducible data science

Developing a handbook for best practice in academic data science

## Introduction

Reproducible research is work that can be independently verified.
In practice, it means sharing the data and code that were used to generate published results - yet this is often easier said than done.
The Turing Way is a guide to reproducible data science that will support students and academics as they develop their code, with the aim of helping them produce work that will be regarded as gold-standard examples of trustworthy and reusable research.

## Project aims

In the ideal case, all published results should be independently verifiable and suitable for other researchers to build upon.
For this to happen, the data and code that support the publication need to be made available in an easy-to-use and open format.

Sharing these research outputs means understanding data management, library sciences, software development and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers and data scientists.

The Turing Way is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible data science is "too easy not to do".
It will include training material on version control, analysis testing and open and transparent communication with future users, and build on Turing Institute case studies and workshops.

## Applications

The Turing Way will support everybody involved in data science research: the developers of the code (research engineers, postdocs and doctoral students), their supervisors and the business team members who coordinate these projects.
The format will be easy for the reader to dip in and out of, depending on their level of experience in the various topics.
The project will help to answer questions that researchers don't always ask: "How do I ensure that my code's existing functionality doesn't change as I extend the codebase?", "How do I make my project easy for someone else to run?", and many more.

Senior team members - Turing fellows, program directors and managers - will be catered for with key points tailored towards managing reproducible research projects highlighted for each topic covered.
The project will build and curate checklists for what can be done to ensure all project outputs are reproducible.
A chapter on Binder will be of interest to supervisors who want to regularly review their students' code, and will include the technical details of how to set up a BinderHub that will be useful for research software engineers.

## Recent updates

### The Turing Way as a Jupyter Book

You can now read the Turing Way as a Jupyter Book!
This format lets us offer interactive samples of code alongside the rest of the book's content and presents the book in an easy-to-read format.
You can read the latest version [here](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com) and can suggest and make contributions through our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).

### Binder

The Turing Way has close links with Binder, a project that lets users create reproducible and sharable computational environments via simple configuration files.
Following her contributions to Binder and BinderHub, Turing Way core team member Sarah Gibson has become a [maintainer](https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/team.html#binder-team) for the BinderHub project and the public instance of Binder, [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/).

The Turing Way held three workshops in early 2019.

The two _Boost your research reproducibility with Binder_ workshops demonstrated the importance of reproducible computational environments and helped participants to create their own Binder-ready projects.
Everyone who attended said they felt confident using Binder to share their work reproducibly!

The _Build a BinderHub_ workshop led participants through the steps to deploying their own BinderHub on Microsoft Azure.
Sarah held a repeat edition of the _Build a BinderHub_ workshop at the 2019 Conference of Research Software Engineering, where she was also on the panel for _RSE Worldwide: Sharing across borders_.

Materials for the [_Boost your research reproducibility with Binder_](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder) and [_Build a BinderHub_](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/workshops/build-a-binderhub) tutorials can be found in our GitHub repository.

### Community events

Two successful Book Dashes, held in [Manchester](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-mcr-report.md) and [London](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-ldn-report.md) in May 2019, led to many contributions: new chapters, improvements to existing chapters, streamlining the path for new contributors and a host of [beautiful illustrations](https://zenodo.org/record/3332808).

The Turing Way team regularly hold Collaboration Cafes on the first and third Wednesdays of each month.
These events are places to come together (online) to work on contributions to the Turing Way.
The times of the events vary to suit contributors from across the world - you can see the upcoming schedule and details of how to join [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md).

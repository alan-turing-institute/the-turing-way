# Leadership and Management
## Management
<p align="justify">
 The term <b><i>"Management"</i></b> always leads us to think about the ways for <i>organising, controlling</i> and most pre-eminently <i>coordinating</i> the works, events and persons together as a team so as to accomplish <b>"Team Work"</b>. <i>But have you ever give a thought that it never discusses about the location of the team members, no matter wherever you and your team members are located, whether nearby or faraway, you have to manage your tasks and work efficiently as well as productively!!!</i>:thinking: 
</p>

While working in a group or a team, every individual must take care of the following classifications of the *Management*:

</p>
<p align="justify">
 
While keenly observing the above classifications, it should be noted that it follows <b>3T's Practices</b>:
1. <strong>T</strong>eam Management
2. <strong>T</strong>ime Management
3. <strong>T</strong>ask Management
</p>
 
## Team Managemt
 <p align="justify">
 <b><i>Team Management</i></b> is something which is not only done by the manager of the team, it's you also, as a member of the same group which constitutes finally as a team which lets you not to forget that the <b><i>Manager is also one of the member of the same  team to which you also belong.</i></b>The following points must be taken care of by both, the <i>The Manager</i> as well as the <i>The Team Member</i>:

<ul>
 <li><b>As a Manager: :man_judge:</b></li>
</ul>
  <ol>
   <li><b><i>Ensure everybody's involvement:</i></b>
    <p align="justify">
It's only the manager of the team who binds the whole team as one unit ensuring participation of each and every member of the team. Although this is one of the prominent challenging task for a manager where the team members are located remotely as all of them will have their different timezones. This issue has been discussed in 
<a href="https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/leadership.md#time-management">Time Management</a>.
 </p>
        <li><b><i>Respect and Appreciate everyone's contribution:</i></b>
             <p align="justify">
              <b><i>“Respect is a two-way street, if you want to get it, you’ve got to give it.”
               -R.G. Risch</i></b>
             </p>
 <p align="justify"> 
 Manager should respect everyone and everybody's time, meanwhile appreciating their works, which will even help you as if a manager to strengthen your bond between your team members and <b>let them feel included as a team</b>.
 </p>
<li><b><i>Solve your team members' issues:</i></b>
  <p align="justify">
   Manager should ensure that nobody is facing any type of difficulties whether it's a communication issue or a technical problem. Manager sholud keep a check on communication channels to confirm that it follows through the right path and fixing out any issue , if so occured which help them to even create more stronger bond among their colleagues. 
 </p>
 <li><b><i>Give equal opportunities:</i></b>
<p align="justify">
 Each member of a team should feel that they all have got equal opportunities to take part and perform as well. Give space to new comers too in your team. It's the duty of a manager to fairly and appropriately allocate task to each member to get the desired output and for effective remote team working.
 </p>
 <li><b><i>Create comfortable environment:</i></b>
<p align="justify">
 It's very important to create a comfortable working environment. Most importantly, it is to be ensured that communication goes effectively with all your colleagues. When working in groups, managers should identify common languages and offer / arrange training and support for those with valulable contributions to make, but without the language skills to communicate them.

 <b><i>" A picture can speak a thousand words,"</i></b> and it's clear from the pictorial representation in the right side, of what a Team Member should concern while working remotely in a group or a team. A <b>Team Member</b> must possess the quality of working collectively and collaboratively with other members, which will benefit them in a team as a whole. Admiring others in a team will help them to strengthen their bond among themselves.<b><i> "Better three hours too soon than a minute too late." – William Shakespeare,</i></b> and hence one should respect even the time in addition to its colleagues. Managers sholud also take care of the fact that deadlines should be mutually agreed in accordance with capacity to complete tasks by team members. Always keep in mind, as a member of the team, to work productively and efficiently so that the assigned task should complete on time and the work can be published on time. At any moment if you are feeling that you are going in two-minds :confused:, discuss the issues and difficulties you are facing with your team members, they will help you!!!:handshake:

## Time Management
<img src="https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/time_manage.png" width="50%" align="left" hspace="0" vspace="0">
<p align="justify">
<b><i>"Time is the wisest counselor of all." – Pericles.</i></b> and <b><i>"The key is in not spending time, but in investing it." – Stephen R. Covey.</i></b> and hence one of the most prominent challenge as discussed in the previous section. Even it's more difficult to establish a best communication channel among the members of the team who are remotely located. Although there are various platforms on which this can be approach like <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>,<a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-in/">Slack</a>,<a href="https://www.troopmessenger.com/">Troop Messenger</a>,<a href="https://gitter.im/">Gitter</a>, and <a href="https://qz.com/work/1147877/remote-work-why-we-put-virtual-coffee-breaks-in-our-company-handbook/">Coffee-breaks</a> and many more. But, the common problem among them all is the different timezones of the team members whose locations are varied. The only best solution to get rid of this problem is to discuss with all the team members and finalize the time based on everyone's conveniency. If everybody is comfortable with the finalized time then only it's possible to have an efficient meeting and can work efficiently. It's nothing wrong to plan ahead, as <b><i>"As Tommorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today."</i></b> For Better planning, one should practice:
 <ul>
  <li>Calendar's Mark</li>
  <li>Reminder</li>
  <li>Mention different timezones</li>
  <li>Options for selecting appropriate time</li>
  <li>Time Duration for different tasks</li>
  </ul>
   and most importantly,<b><i> Organise</i></b> everything in an effective manner.
 </p>

## Task Management
The *Task Management* will go efficiently if we all , whole as a team, must follow the following **10 P's**: 
<img src="https://github.com/IIITM-Jay/Data-Licenses/blob/master/task.png" width="40%" height="100%" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">
<p align="justify">
1. <b>Participation:</b> The First <b>P</b> stands for <i>Participation</i> which emphasizes on full involvement of each and every member of a team. It's your own responsibility that you should take part in every specific discussion as one of the team member, sharing your own ideas.

  <ul>
   <li>Number of tasks</li>
   <li>Time it takes for each task to complete</li>
   <li>Everybody should comfortable in the working environment</li>
   <li>Communication channel must be well-established</li>
   <li>There should be no loop hole and everybody must remain in the same working loop</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
5.<b> Priorities:</b> After getting ready with the plan, ask the manager or discuss among the team members to <b>Prioritize</b> the tasks accordingly and set the milestones correspondingly. Manager/ Group leader will take care of the allocation of the task according to the skills each member possesses.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">

 </p>
<p align="justify">

 <p align="justify">

  </p>
  <p align="justify">

 </p>
 <p align="justify">
 10.<b> Publish:</b> <i>Hooray,:tada: we have <b>Published</b> our work.</i>:rocket:.  Now, it's time for party.:champagne:
 </p>

## Leadership
<p align="justify">
Managing is not an easy task , as mentioned above. It takes a lot of efforts to organize and conduct in an effective manner taking care of all the above points. Therefore, a <b>"Leader/ Manager"</b> should be respected. A <i>leader/ Manager</i> is the only one <b><i>"Who ties all the team members together into a single rope whose knot can't be opened easily."</i></b> signifying <i>"Unity is strength... when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved."</i><br>
 A leader must concern about all three managements discussed and keep regularly discussing with the team members.

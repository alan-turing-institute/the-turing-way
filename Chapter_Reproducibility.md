### Definitions of reproducibility

Copied from ROpenSci Reproducibility Guide:

Victoria Stodden [(2014)](http://edge.org/response-detail/25340), a prominent scholar on this topic, has identified some useful distinctions in reproducible research:

- _Computational reproducibility_: when detailed information is provided about code, software, hardware and implementation details.

- _Empirical reproducibility_: when detailed information is provided about non-computational empirical scientific experiments and observations. In practise this is enabled by making data freely available, as well as details of how the data was collected.

- _Statistical reproducibility_: when detailed information is provided about the choice of statistical tests, model parameters, threshold values, etc. This mostly relates to pre-registration of study design to prevent p-value hacking and other manipulations. 

[Stodden et al. (2013)](http://stodden.net/icerm_report.pdf) place **computational reproducibility** on a spectrum with five categories that account for many typical research contexts:

> - _Reviewable Research_. The descriptions of the research methods can be independently assessed and the results judged credible. (This includes both traditional peer review and community review, and does not necessarily imply reproducibility.)
> - _Replicable Research_. Tools are made available that would allow one to duplicate the results of the research, for example by running the authorsâ€™ code to produce the plots shown in the publication. (Here tools might be limited in scope, e.g., only essential data or executables, and might only be made available to referees or only upon request.)
> - _Confirmable Research_. The main conclusions of the research can be attained independently without the use of software provided by the author. (But using the complete description of algorithms and methodology provided in the publication and any supplementary materials.)
> - _Auditable Research_. Sufficient records (including data and software) have been archived so that the research can be defended later if necessary or differences between independent confirmations resolved. The archive might be private, as with traditional laboratory notebooks.
> - _Open or Reproducible Research_. Auditable research made openly available. This comprised well-documented and fully open code and data that are publicly available that would allow one to (a) fully audit the computational procedure, (b) replicate and also independently reproduce the results of the research, and (c) extend the results or apply the method to new problems.
